Sooraj Barjatya, the filmmaker writes in the prologue for the book that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Each chapter makes you want to go home, plan a family dinner, sit and laugh together.Ã¢â‚¬Â In her foreword, Dr. Indu Shahani, the Dean of the Indian School of Management and Entrepreneurship and former Principal of the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai refers to the young couple and says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fulfilment they gave to each other flowed out of them to their families, friends, neighbours and patients and created ever-widening circles of happiness.Ã¢â‚¬Â\nYoung people in love can learn from the book how to win their parents and others against their alliance for religious or other reasons. The young, as well as old generations, will find the book helpful to enjoy and stay up together in a joint family, in spite of space or other constraints. Do read the chapter Servants or Helpers about those who enjoyed working for the author. She preferred to use the term Helpers and has quite a few Friends whom she helped to a great extent to come up in life. Those fond of pets will find the chapter Our Life with our Dogs, very touching. The chapter Supporting Raj describes how spouses can support each other for having a happy and purposeful life.",

                "post_content": "It is said that the memories of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing years form the deepest impressions. Nothing could be truer. In the mid-1950s I spent my early years in Calcutta when the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culture was a blend of the colonial times and the first flush of independence. It was an interesting mix which made Calcutta one of the most livable cities in the country. Optimism and hope mingled with old world charm to offer the denizen the best of both worlds.\n\nAs a 10-year old student of the Our Lady Queen of the Mission School referred to in this story, the Anglo-Indians made a big impact on me. Especially the flamboyant sort who rode powerful motorcycles with sexy girls in short skirts riding pillion. As I grew older, this community dwindled in number, as many of them migrated to the UK, Australia, Canada and other places around the world.\n\nThis community was born out of the union of British men and women of Indian origin in early colonial times. This union was encouraged by the rulers to expand their presence significantly. It created for them a workforce for top positions in the railways, missionary schools, customs, excise, posts &amp; telegraph and forest departments and elsewhere. Their control was complete and the Anglo-Indians were more British in their ways than the British themselves.\n\nThis story is about a married Anglo-Indian who falls in love with an Indian boy young enough to be her son. The story also refers to the deep-rooted scar of the white-skin complex left by the Anglo-Indian community which continues to exist to this day. Though a piece of fiction, the story draws heavily from incidents I was witness to during my growing years.\n\nI hope that I have been successful in my attempt. For this story is my tribute to the city I cherish. A place of which I have the fondest of memories. Strange as it may sound, I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had the opportunity to visit it ever since I left it half-a-century ago. I hope both, the city and I, wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be separated for much longer anymore.",

He noticed the value of each day and the value of life for the first time.\nGuruji guided him to balance short life in a fulfilling manner.\nGradually, he stopped worrying about death. He wanted his life to be meaningful; satisfied, fulfilled with contentment. He opened new vistas of life. He explored new avenues of life. He acquired new habits; discarded bad ones. He investigated the essence of life. He planned for his life. Ultimately, he got strengthened to aspire to defeat his own death!\nNow he is prepared to lead an all-new life; if he gets a new lease of life.\nWe, all, generally donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand the value of life. We actually miss our life in the name of living on materialistic aspirations.\nThis is the case with all. The Protagonist displayed the journey of his miniature life and enlightens us about life itself! He questions us- Are you living before dying? The day to day struggles, the emotions, the commotions, feelings, pain, and pleasure are all displayed in this fable.\nHe represents us. He represents our life.</span>",

Narendra who is capable of protecting his motherland is unable to protect his own family. He gets disillusioned by his inability to overcome the societal injustice where even his own blood becomes a tormentor. The intelligible expression, supported by heart-piercing and emotional description aligns the readers with the realities of life where the sharks are out on a prowl for their prey. The catastrophic event of his life forces him to quit his loved profession and settle for a compromise.",

In traditional Indian astronomy, pair of Alcor and Mizar in constellation Ursa Major is known as Arundhati and Vashista. In most twin stars system, one star is stationary and other rotates around it, while Arundhati and Vashishtha both rotate in synchrony. To tell that both husband and wife must do all things in sync and that husband must not rotate around the wife or wife should not dance to the tune of her husband, this ritual was made a part of the marriage ceremony. The greatness of our ancestors/scholars was that they could know that such a twin star system exists much before the discovery of the telescope.\n\nThe question that is to be asked is, \"How did our ancestors/scholars come to know of the existence of such a pair of Stars that rotated about each other?\" The entire Indian knowledge system has such revelations not only about the Cosmos but also about the Ayurveda medicine, mathematics, building construction technology as is seen in the large temples complexes in India and also in Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Therefore the statement that the ancient Indian scholars did not have a scientific grounding is definitely more an outcome of imperialistic supremacy which was sustained and encouraged by Indians who had a vested interest in following such a path. In fact, Hindu Philosophy is the only philosophy that gives you the freedom to question even the existence of God. This is considered blasphemy in other philosophies/religions!",

She, agitated by some mistake in her project, asked me to take her to some store which was on the outskirts of Rajahmundry, our hometown. I took her there, without annoying her with objections. When we almost reached the place, she asked me to stop and go back to the town to get some things for her, which she forgot. She said she'll walk to the store from there. I remember it so well: I looked around the uninhabited place and I was frightened at the thought of leaving her alone, at that place, at such an inappropriate time. I said I wouldn't go if she didn't come with me. She was frantic. She insisted I should go alone, for in the meanwhile she has much work to get done. Dissenting, I took a promise from her that she'll stay at the store and wouldn't stray away. When I was back, leaving her for half an hour at the abandoned place, she was missing. \\n \\n I searched for her. She was missing.

Her arranged marriage with Sandip, a garment exporter, heralds a series of diabolic predicaments in her life. Within months of her matrimony, she finds herself married to a perverted lecher. Being a very decent woman, she tries every trick in the book to tame her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s morals but with his utter recalcitrance, all her propitiations of salvaging the marriage appear futile.

Her arranged marriage with Sandip, a garment exporter, heralds a series of diabolic predicaments in her life. Within months of her matrimony, she finds herself married to a perverted lecher.

An empathetic connection with those, who are physically challenged, has been established in two of the stories. Some stories, written in the backdrop of the lives of civil servants, make an interesting and informative reading.\n*************\nPoor girl was swinging in the pendulum of hope and expectations on one end to disappointments and rejections on the other. It seemed nobody cared for her feelings. She was unable to gauge\nher own motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intentions. I, as an outsider, felt that there were some selfish and ulterior motives behind the seemingly genuine failures of the sincere attempts to get her married.\n*************\nThey do not know how a zebra is different from a giraffe. They have not seen the hues of nature. How green is the green of the leaves and what it is like when the leaves turn yellow in autumn! They have not seen the radiance of the rising sun or the glow of the full moon. They have not experienced the pleasure of seeing the gigantic mountains or the vast oceans or the meandering clouds.",

I am one of you belonging to a business family living with three generations together. I have experienced various aspects of life working in multiple fields of activities throughout life.\n\nRecently, with the blessings of my Guru Sadhguru Sri Ramesh Ji of Poorna Ananda Ashram Hyderabad I got realization that even, while, living in the family performing all social, economic and family obligations we can adopt spiritual practices and mould ourselves in such a way where we can be the masters of our emotions and Virtues.\n\nThrough this book I am trying to share my experiences to bring out the changes in our response to any behaviour which we receive from others. I feel it will help you to know yourself better who is a PURE SOUL, FULL OF PEACE, and LOVE with DIVINE ENERGY in a HEALTHY BODY. I assure you can change your any habit by just deciding not only wishing, committing not only trying and taking full responsibility not only hoping of the result.",

Will their love last forever or get faded with the winds of destiny? Are all love stories destined to have a rosy ending or love can sometimes demean you, insult you, abuse you eventually directing towards the right path and letting you discover your true passion in life? The book illustrates how the female protagonist in the story after losing everything, which she had once valued the most, takes control of her life and eventually discovers her true/passion in life.

Love is basically like a kaleidoscope and it changes colour in all human relations with time.",

Gita is the ultimate Gyan which teaches us to enjoy our action. It was recited in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when Arjuna was trying to shy away from the war. God says enjoy the battle of life, fight it out, enjoying every bit of it, by giving your full but without being affected by its result; which is not in your hands.\n\nWe walk through our lives as sleep walkers, never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment. Break free of the conditioned belief system and prejudices that limit your capacity to enjoy life in all its richness.\n\nExpand your consciousness; don't just limit it to provide you immense pleasure in situations that touch you deeply; welcoming a new baby into the world the first time, being with someone at the moment of death-when we are aware of every moment, every sound and every thought.\n\nMy previous book Ãƒâ€™HAPPINESS 24/7Ãƒâ€œ was widely appreciated. This book will accelerate your journey on the path of spirituality. It will help to expand yourself, who is a PURE SOUL, FULL OF PEACE, AND LOVE with DIVINE ENERGY in a HEALTHY BODY.",

He tries to share his fears with his father, Mridul who is not ready to accept the existence of a ghost in his home. The tormented child struggles to survive while his father is busy finalizing an important business deal. It is while working on his official project one night that Mridul realizes the presence of a shadow. He is left aghast and has no option but to believe his son. Things take a turn when the shadow reveals its identity to Mridul who is immediately reminded of his buried past.\nThis is one story that you would have to stay up the night for and feel. It has the thrill of paranormal events, a mystery that will keep you wondering, blood rush of young love, the agony of heartbreak, the longing of unrequited love, but more so, it has lessons for a lifetime that will change you.",

There is no person sans any flaws. A strong bond is established by sharing that baggage and admiring those flaws. Meet Ishaan Agarwal.Tag alongside him as you get introduced to his best friends, his ex-college girlfriend, his casual-fling from coaching days, his high-school crush, a CEO without a name, a broad-chest head-bouncer, two tech-savvy entrepreneurs, a quirky-psychic artist, an adorable bride-to-be, an uber-cool watch and a rich-spoilt brat. This list is endless yet incomplete. At the crux of this story lies the most crucial character which can only be found inside this book. You eventually meet her in some chapter, but Ishaan met her via a printed sheet of paper.",

                "post_content": "In the celebration of everything public, there is an undying pang of discovering oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal ghosts.\nThrough a sprawling canvas populated by unlikeliest of people, Asmi challenges herself to knots that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be unknotted. For more than a decade she has cursed her fate for leaving her mother-less and with a woebegone family. As unjust life ensnare her, she dreams of leaving the despairing gullies of Lajpat Nagar. Little did she know, her fairy godmother was set to cast a spell to turn her life around.\nThe mediocre are seldom sanctioned the life of affluence. Torn between her coarse edges and MahiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soft silks, Asmi emerges from the literary world and inhale the air of the rich. Her delight is short lived as humiliation taunts her presence and forces her to congest into a cocoon. Nevertheless, questioning her right to dignity Asmi stands firm challenging the conceited of Delhi. Although soon she realises, the houses that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made of glass include more than skeletons in their closets.\nThrown in unexpected relations, Asmi captivates Amin with her unpretentious approach towards life. Admiring AminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and MahiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable lifestyle she seeks refuge with them and shuns her father. She also finds solace in Rajee, her childhood companion. One wonders, are dysfunctional families a norm in Delhi? Was this a prominent rationale for our protagonists to fuel their bond amidst mismatched society?\nDelhi spares none with mercy including Asmi who is ambushed and stifled. Amid the atrocities by the living and the dead, she is forced to question her existence. Rightly stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happiness is temporaryÃ¢â‚¬Â, she is left distraught in no time. Deceived with heartbreak she finds haven in the subjugated world to evade the gnawing memories of her past.\nWill life offer a prospect to mend her broken relations? Have setbacks strengthened her to conquer hindrances and return to her roots?\nIt is a quest of survival of the mediocre. Evidence of dysfunctional self and withered familial ties become a recurring theme throughout the book.",

Although the story is set up in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modern India, the topics it covers has been around since the dawn of mankind! The absurdity of religion, the rebellion against authority, the ego of the naÃƒÂ¯ve, the naivety of the young, the anxious youth, the nostalgic memories, and the craving for euphoria and love. All of these topics covered under the light-hearted conversations made by three degenerates or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“IndianÃ¢â‚¬Â version of punks.",

Most of the stories have been written around human emotions. Some stories have animals and birds as the main characters. The story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apples and OrangesÃ¢â‚¬Â shows how these fruits are taunting each other to prove their supremacy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Lazy BullÃ¢â‚¬Â highlights how we all are busy in our life while he is enjoying his life lazily. These quick reads promise to make you smile and also make you feel nostalgic.",

These stories are written by some of the finest and most well-known writers of Urdu today - including Shafi Mashhadi, Zakiya Mashhadi, Shomail Ahmed, Shaukat Hayat, Hussain-ul Haq, Abdus Samad, and Qasim Khursheed. Each writer in this volume is unique in his or her style, but all of them are bound by a common history, since they were all born in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, during the first half of the 20th century. These are tales about ordinary men and women, and the challenges they faced and the experiences they encountered in a menacingly class-ridden, morally corrupt, and financially devastated social order. Every story in this collection appeals universally to our sense of distrust and dread about human nature. The stories lead us into a world shaped by the inner and outer conflicts that have wrecked the provincial life of people in the state, but in doing so they reveal the larger social, moral, and political chaos that has devastated the lives of ordinary men and women in the Indian sub-continent. Ultimately, they testify to the depth of human life and reflect upon its mysteries. These short stories masterfully lay bare the whole fabric of Indian society. They capture the dilemma that the characters find themselves in, and a terrible sense of alienation - both within and without Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that defines the existential crisis they are going through. The title of the book is inspired by the tales in this collection, which contains a wide variety of stories tied together in one place. The stories are brought to the English reader inaccurate, modern translations, with originality and poetic grace. The cultural concepts or Urdu words, that are not translatable are annotated in the Glossary. This permits the retention of some Urdu terms in order to be faithful to the cultural setting of the stories, without alienating readers who are not familiar with such terms. This anthology presents to the perceptive English reader a selection of stories comparable in excellence to short fiction written in any other language.</em>",

The most epic mystery of the ancient world.\n\nWhen the richest man of India confesses to being part of a secret society in a live press conference; chaos ensues. His daughter Aanya Vashishtha takes the help of Aarav Kohrrathi, a brilliant but egoistic treasure hunter and his friend Rehann to solve the mystery of The Ring of the Seven, a society of influential men who are tasked to protect the greatest treasure in history. What starts off as a quest to uncover her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret leads them to something bigger which they themselves couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have fathomed. They take the help from her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s associate, Shayna Maheshwari, a billionaire banker and someone herself involved with the secret, as they progress towards a treasure hidden somewhere in the Himalayas.\n\nThey brave bullets, puzzles, deadly chases, a cult of assassins, and betrayal as their quest takes them across the length and breadth of South Asia; from the bustling metropolises of Mumbai and Delhi to the ancient temples of Nepal; from the serene beaches of Sri Lanka to the towering mountains of the Himalayas. They try to uncover a set of secret books of lost arts, which are believed to reveal the map of the treasure and strive to discover the identities of the masters of the Ring of the Seven to solve the penultimate mystery.\n\nIn a tale of love and loss, logic and emotions, religion and history, action and adventure, and the trial of a few good men against the most powerful organization in the history of mankind. Will they find the secret of the Himalayan treasure?",

Somehow though true happiness eludes us and we keep searching but we are never quenched of this thirst.\n\nWisdom is to know what to seek; it is said we may gain the whole world only to lose our soul. However if the soul is found, eternal bliss shall come to us forever.\n\nOur inherent nature is one of perfection as we are a part of an infinite consciousness. The same ocean of infinity that makes the whole universe roll also bmathes in us.\n\nMy book gives you an introduction to basic ideas about our minds and away to seek a truth beyond it. l try to get you to a state of mind and a realization that what you seek is actually you. You are the happiness that you have been looking for.",

                "post_content": "This collection of short stories offers a fresh prespective of the global Indian experience in the 21st century, as seen through women's eyes. Here you will find stories written by women living and working in India, as well as stories written by those who live across the world, in places as far-flung as the United States of America, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Indonesia and New Zealand amongst others. The stories speak of love, of anger, of sorrow, of desire as well as hope. They give voice to ideas of displacement and the art of making anew in unfamiliar spaces. Proudly and defiantly multicultural, these stories do not shirk away from disquieting themes which challenge the status quo and shine a light on social currents and topics which straddle the collision of idealism and reality. Everything, from the quest for emancipation to the looming threat of female foeticide to the stories of the every woman, as\nshe asserts her identity in a new land to the stories of women who use their pasts to write their presents and even the story of those who have been affected by a hidden exodus. Every such tale has found a home within these pages. While many of these stories fall into the genre regarded as contemporary fiction, others are fine examples of sci-fi while yet others still, retell the tales of figures from mythology, reimagining them as they negotiate the trials and turbulences of modern life. These stories will resonate with every reader keen to support the voices of women more often written about, than writing.",

When sons of Satyavati died childlessly, she, fearing the passing of throne back to Bhishma, decided to do something unthinkable and immoral. She called her eldest son born out of a brief encounter with Sage Parashar. She asked him to make the widows of her son pregnant. It didn't go very well with the subjects, generals and nobles of the court. Bhishma remained silent. But deep inside he was hurt. He decided to avenge his insult. He vowed to end the lineage of Satyavati completely.",

It is a detailed self-realisation process that results in awakening the perceptions and emotions that emerge when someone really precious but malignant is taken away from one's life, that is a state of grace. From talking about death to the wildernesses of love, this book engages you into the realms and depths of life, in the most surreal and enigmatic ways.",

Apart from the usage of certain examples that relate Gita to the current era and some interpretations regarding those examples, nothing new is added from outside.\nThe motive behind this writing venture is to present Bhagavad Gita to a reader who is not well acquainted with religious books or spirituality. Gita is retold here with the utmost care given to preserving its original flow and simplicity. Extreme vigilance is shown in keeping away heavy spiritual words like individual consciousness, universal consciousness, transcendental opulence etc.\nThe Summary of Bhagavad Gita is intended to be read in one sitting. It contains less than eighteen thousand words only.\nThe book may entertain you or it may bore you. But it will never confuse you.",

But Aafreen is not a meek girl as the dark people responsible for dark secrets have presumed. They have a tough time getting hold of her. Brave Aafreen loses her family, friends and all those people whom she loved.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ She manages to flee from the clutches of dark people but suffers a terrible depression thereafter. People around her keep on dying. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on. She always feels she is being watched. Every moment makes her feel that she is the next in line to die at unknown hands.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ She is saved from these thoughts by the police who astonishingly accuse her of all the murders- merciless murders of 6 men.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Has she really committed those murders or is somebody trying to frame her up? Will Aafreen ever be able to live a normal life? Will she ever be loved again? Prepare yourselves for an intriguing read.",

If this medicine is as per dose, injected to an immediately dead person, such dead person slowly wakes-up and becomes alive. The power of medicine doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t last longer than an hour initially. Scientists with the support of a friend Vishal, experiment this medicine on a dead body. This experiment becomes successful. Few Souls, Spirits become Ghosts, Devils, and Satans. All these things create trouble for the Doctor and Vishal. At the graveyard, all sorts of dead bodies come alive and then die.\nScientist Shyam will be kidnapped by anti-social elements for ransom. These ghosts, devils and Satan, loot money from various sources and keep the money in Doctor VishalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house. There are scenes like club, pubs, Casanova, horse races, gambling places, hotel scenes, where these ghosts, devils and Satans make a nuisance and create trouble for all the people.",

It is a magical synthesis of strangeness and beauty packed with suspense and surprise. The novel is a quest for the unknown, the unexplained. Guilt and remorse are watered down when the high priest of holy sacrament forgives and extends a hand to support and rescue the lame lamp.\n\nMan and woman are made for each other, no doubt but how to search for the right partner to share the apple of knowledge with her. There the journey begins, but never ends. The life of Raajasekharan Nair was a quest for a comfort zone from the beginning. He has many superstitions, inhibitions, emotional weaknesses, and always thinks with his heart rather than head. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story of those who think like him, when the unattended, unrestrained emotional thirst causes disturbances and ruin.\n\nA marvellous story with wide implications to modern life is narrated with an ease and passion which is incomparable in contemporary literature, executed in brilliant style; thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Faith.Ã¢â‚¬Â",

But nothing like the one he was trying to wriggle out of right now. He thought about Mona and wondered what would happen to her without him. He had promises to keep with her and his family as well. He had to flee the city he loved so much and knew so well. He knew all the rules and had tweaked them at will to make the extra money. He also knew that the business he was in was powerful and could manipulate the system, its law and machinery of the state. He felt like a hunted man as he glanced occasionally at the rear-view mirror, totally unaware of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next destination.",

While Smitha is excited for her sister, she cannot feel but disgusted at the way women are treated in Indian society, particularly when it comes to marriage, where the father arranges things for her and pays a dowry to get the man to marry the woman. Smitha vows to defy this even though her mother says, \"We can't change the customs society had been accustomed to for years. It takes a noble person to speak out against these evils.\" Smitha becomes just a noble person. She becomes an independent woman with her own career and source of income, and, therefore, she takes it upon herself to handle marriage proposals. When she finally meets the man she wishes to marry, they settle down in Malaysia and have a son named Bhasker and the story begins to follow his life This story focuses on the beautiful and wonderful aspects of life that occur even in the middle of the dark and painful moments. A series of adventure stories with opportunism and love &amp; romance, packed with exciting incidents to catch the minds of all readers.",

                "post_content": "This is a poetess I admire so much. Her poetry is uniquely hers. Her love for peace and her ability to depict effectively the pain of death and the joy of life, define her existential depth of knowledge of society. After going through a good number of her poems I come to the conclusion that she is a gem yet to be discovered. Her style and diction are apt to the various themes she treats. She writes fluently and reaches the heart of her subject matter easily.\nNayanika Dey is a Humanist poetess and dwells mostly on the affairs of the human person and society. She concerns herself with drawing attention to both her inner thoughts as well as the happenings in the external world that shape society. For example, her writings about peace also mean depicting suffering and the amelioration of the situation perpetuating the pain in the larger society. Peace only can be seen if the disrupting element is removed. She is able to traverse this road in her poetry, capturing peace, and violence and even fear of death playing amongst these themes with the ultimate triumph of producing her chosen subject matter.\nNayanikaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetry is generally complex and sometimes difficult because she perceives a sophisticated world challenging her own sophistication which she gracefully brings to bear on her writings. A typical Nayanika stanza, like the second stanza in The Woebegone Bench, thus:\n\n'Our stories are covered and graved below its tapered cabriole shins,\nThe drunk air filling the lancet arches,\nAnd quatrefoils of dissolved faces,\nForging in flames of the bygone ages.\nThe cresting rail and spindles,\nAre now draped in gossamer cobwebs,\nWhile its apron homes the lost sighs and pain,\nNamelessly and latently as they rain.Ã¢â‚¬Â,\ntells volumes of the sophistication of the poet. However, the pleasure in patiently digging deep to understand the poet and unravelling her thought and essence is highly rewarding. The conclusion I can draw is that NayanikaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work can only come from a great spirit of a person residing in her adorable young body.'\"\n-Dr Rashid Pelpuo\nHon. Dr. Rashid Pelpuo was three times a Minister in Ghana.\nHe was the Minister, for Youths and Sports and twice Minister of State at the office of the President, one being in charge of Private Sector Development.\nPresently an elected Member of Parliament he served as the Deputy Majority Leader of Ghana's Parliament in the 6th Parliament. He is the Ambassador at Large of World Institute for Peace (WIP) for West African Countries. He won the award of World Icon of Peace last month for the recognition of his distinct performance in peace promotion and humanitarian services.",

Or does it only give us a chance, just to accept things the way they are, and make peace with it? Does it seem fair, when we start feeling robbed of all the things that once gave us a reason to feel alive?These are just some of the questions Arjun has to face, after a dire tragedy threatens to choke the life out of his existence. Does he manage to find any answers? Does he succeed in finding out the true meaning of choice, and destiny? Or does he succumb to the menacing void left in his life? A void, that threatens to wipe out everything and everyone around him.The Orange Sky is a story about love, longing and the unforeseen complexities of life. A story about how we try to find our way home, one way or the other.",

Entering into her marriage with stars in her eyes, her honeymoon period ends soon and she is jolted into reality. After thirteen years of marriage and two children, Smita has become fat, dull, boring and a doormat. Her husband hardly looks at her, her children donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need her, she has a pot belly, double chin, greying hair and no self-respect. Guided by Roshini and the flamboyant Durga, she enters into the world of discovering her vibrant side through the Mrs. Perfect contest - a journey of how she sets out to improve her life and ends up changing more than her figure. What will happen in the contest? Will the road she has taken prove to be a better path? How will her husband respond? Will it rekindle their lost love? Will her children respect her? The story is an exploration of the wishes and longings that live deep inside every woman's heart where bowed down by society, adhering to its norms and compromising on her choices, she clips the wings of her dreams but hides them in her heart- no longer a mother, a wife, a daughter, a daughter-in-law, but herself.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:7165,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13421772}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13421772}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13421772}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:13421772}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Times New Roman\\&quot;, serif&quot;}\">Smita is about to marry Avinash, her prince in shining armor, and dreams of a home filled with children, love, and happiness.

Her husband hardly looks at her, her children donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need her, she has a pot belly, double chin, greying hair, and no self-respect. Guided by Roshini and the flamboyant Durga, she enters into the world of discovering her vibrant side through the Mrs. Perfect contest - a journey of how she sets out to improve her life and ends up changing more than her figure. What will happen in the contest? Will the road she has taken prove to be a better path? How will her husband respond? Will it rekindle their lost love? Will her children respect her? The story is an exploration of the wishes and longings that live deep inside every woman's heart where bowed down by society, adhering to its norms and compromising on her choices, she clips the wings of her dreams but hides them in her heart- no longer a mother, a wife, a daughter, a daughter-in-law, but herself.</span>",

A series of unprecedented events leave them no choice but to come forward to take control. The life-sustaining elixir of the universe, Amrit, is threatened as the Takshaks, lead by the powerful Kaalsarp, are in search of Kaalkoot, the most lethal venom that ever existed. The Amrit originated from the Samudramanthan, the great cosmic churn that gave rise to this universe, alongside Kaalkoot, its anti-matter. Shiva from the Godverse, one of the creators of this universe, held most of the Kaalkoot inside him to protect the life in the universe from annihilation even before its creation. A portion of Kaalkoot that remained, is hidden somewhere protected by the Vasukis as it can never be destroyed. The Takshaks hold a chronic vengeance against humans since the times of Mahabharata. The Takshak king then had assassinated King Parikshit and in retaliation, the united human kingdoms had massacred Naagmanavs and the few who survived started living in oblivion and slowly over time, Naagmanavs became a myth.\nBut, not anymore as Kaalsarp tries to take control of the world with plans of creating weapons of mass destruction from Kaalkoot to take control of the world. Some humans and Naagmanavs join forces for the Herculean task to stop Kaalsarp. Thereafter starts a thrilling adventure that tests their strength and wits to the limits to defeat the common enemy in order to save the world. Secrets revealed during their quest can change the way mankind has perceived the world forever.",

Against the clock? Meet Manab Banerjee, the Station Master. A regular guy, like you, or that guy there wearing that rather nondescript shirt. Except, as the quintessential Indian Railways man, he dealt with them routinelyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Strange wails in the still of a misty nightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a bloody beheading on the platformÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a mysterious lady with an aura of dangerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ gold biscuitsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a brutal murderÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a catastrophic accident in the stationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and a storm that led to a death and its consequencesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ all these and more. Manab meets them head-on in this collection of ten stories based on real life, resolute but accommodating, quick yet patientÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and always with his heart in the right place.",

It's a myth that we need to go through problems or pain in order to grow as a soul. Soul-growth is a by-product of just being aware of what the Universe is trying to communicate to you at any given point of time.\nWhile transformation, self-awareness and soul-growth have been core reasons for us being on earth in physical bodies, there are also various aspects and tools involved that make our journey towards self-awareness and transformation a lot more graceful. This book has been written to bring about that self-awareness and transformation in the most realistic and simplest of ways.\nThis book isn't about philosophy or self-help, nor is it about practicing rituals or techniques. The words in this book only help create an energy impact strong enough for realisation and awareness to shift within you, without you even knowing it. It's there to accompany you in your journey from here on, just being a light for you to move A Way Ahead than where you already are right now.",

The philosophical mold of the story helps to examine how a person can look inside himself and follow his heart. It takes a closer look at human life through the eyes of an eighteen-year-old college student, Siddharth, who is hollowed out by the guilt of his past. When circumstances bring him together with Maya, they embark on a journey filled with ambition, pain, and hope. This helps in transforming Siddharth's cynical life, but an unexpected encounter with his past crimes forces him to make a choice between pursuing his dreams and clearing his conscience.",

Panning across all genres, each story is a revelation.... if one takes you in a journey inwards the other looks outward to a myopic world. The stories help you traverse from the urbane life to the slums to the middle class roll on. The mesh of relationships, conjugal, sibling, extra-marital-so delicately sketched and eloquently worded. All with one underlying messageafter all we are all mortals. No judgement, just an interlude which encompasses all the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. And leaves it to the reader to release and realise. --Ranjana Joshi Literati, poetess and actress. Author of Visual Poetry book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Walking Shadows.",

The book is divided into four parts, not chronologically, drawing in the suspense.</span>",

When young he lived an ordinary life like everybody else going through the travails of a young boy facing deprivation as a result of the poverty he had endured when his father succumbed to an illness. He had to care for his sick mother and brother which he did holding his head high and nurturing the dream of learning English which he got from his father who taught him the beauty of English. But he never cared for English when his father was alive, but on his death, he turned to it and considered English as his Bible. He did well-writing novels and short stories which began to be noticed by publishers. Finally, this novel saw light, and he looks forward to his other works getting noticed, and to live the life of a known writer. But when everything comes calling Fate has its last laugh by knocking him down by a severe stroke that left him bed-bound. But God comes with help and raises him again to get his work ready.",

But, soon she realizes that she has been waiting for that person only. The person who she has been waiting for comes back into her life after four long years. She tries not to love him. She tries to be indifferent, but she can't. She falls in love again and again just to realize that the person would never love her back. One fine day, the person goes away without leaving any contacts. She waits even if she knows that he will never come back. Will her love of life come back? Will he ever know that she had always loved him? Is there happily ever after in this story? Love is a spiritual path which leads to happiness. But, we tend not to accept it. There are reasons- sometimes the outside forces and sometimes our inside forces acting on us. We all must drive through all the confusions and ambiguities to understand that we cannot live without love. But love camouflages itself. We should have that instinct to recognize it. This book will take you away from the world for some time.",

They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thirst for triumph but they fight to live every moment of the path which they have chosen. All they have to fight with is the last hope that in the end, everything will be okay. This is a tale of the faith in ourselves that brings the universe to us and dwells all universal power into us.</span>",

For more than a decade she has cursed her fate for leaving her mother-less and with a woebegone family. As unjust life ensnare her, she dreams of leaving the despairing gullies of Lajpat Nagar. Little did she know, her fairy godmother was set to cast a spell to turn her life around.\nThe mediocre are seldom sanctioned the life of affluence. Torn between her coarse edges and MahiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soft silks, Asmi emerges from the literary world and inhale the air of the rich. Her delight is short lived as humiliation taunts her presence and forces her to congest into a cocoon. Nevertheless, questioning her right to dignity Asmi stands firm challenging the conceited of Delhi. Although soon she realises, the houses that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made of glass include more than skeletons in their closets.\nThrown in unexpected relations, Asmi captivates Amin with her unpretentious approach towards life. Admiring AminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and MahiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable lifestyle she seeks refuge with them and shuns her father. She also finds solace in Rajee, her childhood companion. One wonders, are dysfunctional families a norm in Delhi? Was this a prominent rationale for our protagonists to fuel their bond amidst mismatched society?\nDelhi spares none with mercy including Asmi who is ambushed and stifled. Amid the atrocities by the living and the dead, she is forced to question her existence. Rightly stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happiness is temporaryÃ¢â‚¬Â, she is left distraught in no time. Deceived with heartbreak she finds haven in the subjugated world to evade the gnawing memories of her past.\nWill life offer a prospect to mend her broken relations? Have setbacks strengthened her to conquer hindrances and return to her roots?\nIt is a quest of survival of the mediocre. Evidence of dysfunctional self and withered familial ties become a recurring theme throughout the book.\nwhy we love to love.\nThis is a tale of an ordinary woman in love. The only difference is there is no beginning or an end. Just like love, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a continuum. Her voracious search for love often comes to a hault but never to an end.",

With absolutely no family background in the legal profession, she sets out to explore the various opportunities this not so common but the upcoming field of law brings her way. Written in the form of short stories and inspired by some true events, the author, through the protagonist Sia, narrates to us a few such unusual and memorable incidents including some eccentric court room dramas, all of which left a deep impact in her life. This debut book is an honest attempt to talk about the law with a dash of satire, with an aim to reach out to all those who may or may have never heard anything about the legal profession nor would have ever stepped inside a court. And for those who are a part of it already, they might relate to it in some way. Just read along and enjoy the short but bumpy ride.\n\"An impressive, coming of age slice of life journey of a young lawyer, the book is an interesting read for youngsters in the profession and for all those curious about the profession.\" --Mr Tuhin A.Sinha, Author",

Her single mother expires; thereafter she elopes with a man by believing his fake promises of love and commitment who indulges her into a flesh trade in Varanasi. The story portrays a beautiful girl who is strong, voracious towards life, who breaks down at times but doesn't fail to get up by accumulating all the pieces left of her.",

                "post_content": "RECOMMENDED by The US Review of Books. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Retired international civil servant Zia Ahmed offers a thorough recollection of his life, spanning three main segments: his youth in village India during that countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s independence struggles, his professional life in the new state of Pakistan as a young man, and his post at the UN before leaving public life. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. Blessed with a brilliant mind and a prodigious memory, Ahmed has interspersed his personal story with passages about the history and culture of the many places he has lived and traveled. His observations are well considered, worth reading even by those outside his immediate heritage. His written English is impeccable, an admirable feat for someone who grew up in foreign lands, and his account of his remarkable life is tempered with modesty. Autobiography infused with sociocultural observations of the world in transition from the 1930s to the present, A Bridge with Three Spans highlights one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s noteworthy aspirations and accomplishments.Ã¢â‚¬ÂReviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott.\nFIVE STAR REVIEW by The Pacific Book Review. Excerpt: While AhmedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing certainly fulfills his intent to capture personal memories, his story is also a creative rendering of acute observations that reveal spans of time, place, and relevant history. The final result is a fluid memoir that depicts a life truly enriched by its connective experiences.Ã¢â‚¬Â Reviewed by Carol Davala.\nNOMINATED CATEGORY FINALIST 2017 by Eric Hoffer Book Review.",

Together, they form a power couple who go on a rampage to create a wildfire of positivity in their surroundings.\nFor them, the coolest thing is not to climb an active volcano or walk a glacier, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to make friends with a vagabond and give an honest effort to make his or her life better.\nEvery time Angel does something crazy and creates a messy situation, Rishabh savors her Crazigasm first and clears the mess later.\nOnly this time, the mess involves Baba, the local goon whose business gets affected because of this crazy couple. What happens next can be found in the pages prior to this blurb.",

Age had changed her as well, but her eyes remained the same, hidden beneath the lightly smudged kohl. Only it seemed, that they had lost their light. That spark had been dimmed the day she left him behind.Ã¢â‚¬Â This is a simple story of belief, trust and self-sacrifice in the very ardour of love for someone who is lost to you forever. It is the relationship between life and the individual that this tale seeks to unravel in a mere thousand words. Even though there is a surge of love stories in the market, there are very few stories that will touch your heart and have elements of surrealism and eternity in them. Sojourn is one such love story where the author delves into the past life of a thirty-six-year-old woman, in whose heart is locked away a romance of her time.",

Arijit, a young boy struggling to overcome his sentimental approach towards life, finds himself standing at the edge of this line. Priya is a confident, bold girl and a grammar nerd. On a tragic night, she is lost in an indecent locality of the city. Kabir is a free-minded and easy-going guy with few expectations and high hopes from life. He tries to hit on every girl he meets but fails miserably. The Pragmatic is a story of these guys. About their friendship, love and crucial decisions in life.",

Beliefs are whims and truths are a ploy.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœWho is Zahana Shah?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ is the very question raking her psyche after spending years hightailing across Europe. In an alter life she was an artist selling her artefacts on the luxe fashion street of Rome. In the same alter life she was riding bikes, flying high, dreaming the dreams of love and living them while having the best time of her life.\n\nToday, she walks down the streets of Delhi with an identity so incredible, a bag of secrets so heavy, an inheritance so empowering, a death streak so strong and animosity so revolting. Her plan, to blast a bomb inside a leading multi-billion dollar company of India, jolts the entire nation. Her desire to avenge Jake and his accomplices takes a mysterious turn that leaves her flabbergasted. But she is not alone. Keeping a track of her intentions, desires, rage and menace is Abhay - the very man everyone in the country had seen but none remembered.\n\nThe only downside of invalidity is that it will be validated someday. How far will she go for love and how farther yet for hate, and finally how farthest to validate her existence and of the unknown man she has known most of her life?",

The lion tells him of the secret that the forest beholds and asks him to join him and be a part of a prophecy that entitles him to be the chosen one.\n\nIf Shiv decides to go with the lion, he will have to join him to some uncertain location, and if he decides not to, he can go back to his life and be the same he has always been. He can either learn all the secrets of the forest or stay unknown to all the secrets that the forest behold. All that happens to him later depends on the decision of his journey. Is he going to live some ordinary life like all ordinary people or is he going to be the chosen one by taking all the risks of his life and take the longest and the most dangerous walk of his life with a lion?\n\nAll that happens, now, stands on his decision.",

Many do not have an idea about Schizophrenia - an abnormal social behaviour in which the victim fails to recognise what is real. He lives on his own false beliefs. This book also throws light on how family environments and falling into a wrong friend circle can ruin one's life. Neel is one such character who becomes a victim of Schizophrenia i.e, he hallucinates his whole life due to many factors. His first move into a false world started from his childhood itself. Neel, being the son of a rich businessman was found in a mental asylum years later. This is NeelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey that brings my book alive.",

                "post_content": "Nirvana for Dummies unfolds the way to the state of perfect bliss for everyone. It lays down a step-by-step process for you to become happier, healthier and wiser no matter where you stand currently. It is an ideal self-help book for those who wish to swim, rather than sink, in the ocean called the Ã¢â‚¬ËœuniverseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that Life has plunged us in! The book blends the ancient science of Yoga (Yoga-Shastra) with positive psychology. It is not a typical Ã¢â‚¬ËœYogaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ book dwelling merely on postures or breathing techniques. What you WILL find inside Ã¢â‚¬ËœNirvana for DummiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a holistic approach for integrating Yoga-science into each situation and every action so that your entire life-experience becomes a celebration. Your life is a cyclical process. Each cycle consists of a stimulus from your environment, your cumulative response to it in terms of behaviour and the results you reap thereof. This book will improve your Awareness through Ã¢â‚¬ËœJnana YogaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Yoga of Knowledge), Behavior through Ã¢â‚¬ËœKarma YogaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Yoga of Action) and (acceptance of) Consequences through Ã¢â‚¬ËœBhakti YogaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Yoga of Surrender). The book will also demonstrate to you how the practice of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAshtanga YogaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Eight-limbed Yoga) complements each of these facets. In an era where people are practising Yoga in bits and pieces (and therefore deriving piecemeal benefits), this book tries to construct the entire jig-saw puzzle so you know precisely where YOUR pieces fit in. How Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgoose-bumpyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is it then, based on this knowledge, to lead the rest of your life with full awareness, steely purpose and high-impact actions?",

                "post_content": "Pocket Of Smile\"\" is a collection of soul-enchanting verses with several conversations to toss out the wrenched thoughts and reach the pinnacle of self-realization and peace.\n\nIt is the journey of a woman recollecting her memories while she is inside the pocket of smile and each day she makes a promise to be happy and smile irrespective of any obstacles she is going through. Sometimes we feel ourselves so much cocooned and suffocated that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow our emotions to live the way they want, and this is where few pages from Pocket of Smile are taken out to help them to emote the way they want to get re-kindled.\nIt is an emotional walk that depicts the many facets of life and the emotional ups and downs that the soul experiences before emerging and breathing freely after being sidetracked so frequently. She walked from an abstract place to this earthly world to realize herself and get the courage to stand independently. Poems use metaphors of many shades of life to weave many threads for the soul, like joy, happiness, love, grief, pain, loneliness, success, rejection, acceptance, expectations, expressions, life, hatred, and moments when she finally meets her soul.",

Men are welcome to help themselves to it as well, but they may find themselves somewhat lost in a literary setting that nudges them aside, albeit playfully.\nAt 28, Jayanti is seemingly a woman who has it all: a good looking fiancÃƒÂ© who is a pilot in the Air Force, a well-paying cushy job, two loving parents and close friends. But in reality she is unravelling. Alok, her fiancÃƒÂ©, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold the mojo for her anymore. She hates her job. After six years on the same beat, she wants something more out of her life. Her life comes undone pretty much after her chance encounter with Russo at an art gallery in Hyderabad where she lives. Russo is not just an artist but also a drug dealer, working for a Goan drug overlord, Jimmy. Unsuspectingly, through a strange sequence of events involving her naÃƒÂ¯ve maid Vijji, Jayanti finds herself in a heady situation mixed with drugs and goons that takes her to Gokarna, even as she falls head over heels in love with Russo. Her two friends Arpita, a Tollywood starlet and Srilaxmi, a much married woman looking for excitement, are along for the ride. The journey, although foolishly motivated, helps her and her friends, find some answers for themselves.",

For the strong and wealthy, it is a war for more power and wealth. And, of course, there is one war simmering unabated since the time of Adam &amp; Eve . . . Man v/s Woman!\n\nMan feels superior to Woman. Woman finds Man overbearing. This then forms the genesis of a war that ends in nemesis for both.\n\nThe truth is that like night and day, pain and pleasure, man and woman are inseparable. If one is the song, the other is its very rhythm. If one is the stronger among the two, the other is the very secret of this strength. Lucky couples who realise this truth will find life a journey of joy. Others too blinded by their ego will remain on a path of pain.\n\nThe Anands are one such couple in love and at war too. Will they be lucky?",

Nobody other than AyodhyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandpa knows about its location. The grandpa is stubborn. Despite several physical assaults and threats, he has successfully hidden the VillaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s location and AyodhyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity from the relatives. Elsewhere, the island of Dweepa has surfaced in the Arabian Sea due to unprecedented earthquakes. The most beautiful island on earth, Dweepa, is immediately occupied by India. But Dweepa has been a victim of disappearances of high-profile individuals and common men alike. ACP Sagar, IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top cop, and head constable Jackpot are being troubled by a mysterious man who is known to be the mastermind behind the vanishings. The man is known to have not only brute strength but also extreme intelligence and strategy. But there is an unusual player. Ayodhya has been toiling in the IT industry by the day and secretly hunting the mystery man by the night. The edge-of-the-seat thriller, with its dark and deathly plot, is narrated by a strange being that seems to know everything about the reader too.",

At 37, she had survived a bad marriage and betrayal of her husband of 2 years and post-divorce another failed romantic relationship. So now she is searching for the true meaning of relationships &amp; she concludes that she needs someone of her own, who will not leave her in the middle of the road. Like having her own child.\nShe faces a breakup with her current boyfriend in the process of convincing him of letting her have his child, although she was keeping him off the hook of marriage and responsibility of raising the child.\n\nMaya Marathe, her paternal granny, who turns 18 years old in 1942, is caught up in the web of traditions and restrictions imposed on her by her family &amp; her community, directly or indirectly. She is doomed with the prospect of a traditional marriage which is looming in front of her like a threat and no one is bothered with the fact that she is not interested in this marriage but in fact, wants to pursue further education.\n\nSo, what could be the possible thread to bond these two women who belong to different generations with a gap of almost 70 years separating them from each other and had different upbringings except for the fact that they both belong to the same family?\nMaybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the bond of being women or maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s their quest of finding answers to their existence... So will they find their answers? Or will there be more questions? Or will their journey will lead them to know the meaning of their existence.",

                "post_content": "Humans are wired to follow the path of least resistance. If one doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to do something, he or she will not do it. Technology has enabled humans to work from coffee shops and from home, reducing the need to go to work. The very meaning of work has changed for modern-day workers where the workplace is no more a physical space. The new workplace is a blended space of the physical and the digital.\nThe subconscious mind is like cruise control for humans and shapes behaviour. The environment that one is in conditions the mind. At work, the workplace environment conditions quality of thinking. For organizations in a collaboration economy today, productivity depends on the quality of thinking, and not so much on efficiency. The blended workplace is the starting point of innovation for organizations that believe in innovation. Parthajeet Sarma delves into psychology, human evolution and science to draw connections with greatly changed expectations from work. In his third book, Parthajeet espouses the need for management to get out of codified theories. This facilitates a macro view, leading to a radical new meaning of work, workers and workplaces that is aligned with the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision for the future.\n\nFor more resources, visit: www.idream.in/",

Out of a kabillion galaxies and gazillion planets, who will make it?\nWhy would someone leave their home planet to help Arka? Even if someone does, how will it be to become skilful to defeat the evil heads?\nWill it really suffice?",

Does that make you look over your shoulder in fear?\nProbably not, because all you hear is plain silence. The silence of a tear rolling down, the silence of a heart left deserted and a soul once again deprived of love.\nBut my dear friend, be afraid, be very afraid of this illusion, for this silence is not silence at all. It encompasses a thousand screams that just havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reached your ears; a thousand cries that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet made you comprehend your brutal act.\nThis deadly silence will come to you, when you are lying wide awake in your bed contemplating the loneliness that engulfs you at midnight and when this silence lays down right beside you, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know exactly how the feeling is when it touches your head with its cold fingers and puts you to sleep while your eyes closed with tears frozen in them.\nAnd from that night, that very night, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start dying a little on the inside every time you think of loving someone again.",

They sprout from nowhere and disappear somewhereÃ¢â‚¬Â\n\nAshwini and Vikram had become more than just friends. It was not that he was her boyfriend but she just felt like being with him always.\n\nLife moved on and Ashwini matured over time realizing that the responsibilities and problems one had to shoulder were much more beyond the four walls of the college. As the time came for her engagement, Vikram not only disappeared from the scene but also did not get in touch with her ever. What was in VikramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind when he was with her all the while? Did he really care for Ashwini or was it just a hallucination?\nThanking You with LoveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ will hold the reader till the last page when Ashwini discovers a shocking truth upon returning to her hometown after six years.",

But once margins are breached, it almost doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how deep into our true selves we go. Because then, and only then, can we truly put the madness down on paper and immortalise it in the captivating world of the written word.\n\n'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Notes in the margin', Arindam's second volume of original poetry, is an exploration of outlying thoughts and fleeting emotions, dwelt on over time and woven into kaleidoscopic verse. A verse that ranges from rain to schoolteachers, from abortions to ice creams and from serial killers to eternity.",

They get Ã¢â‚¬Å“kidnappedÃ¢â‚¬Â by Ashimda and his ally, the mystery man. Hence starts a tortuous ordeal for them- sometimes within the closed doors of a dingy room, sometimes while travelling in an unventilated van. They have to traverse miles and miles, across the fields, the jungles and the mountains. In search of what? What are the verses of the mystery poem? Who is the Master and why has he collected only the three of them? Where is the magic wand? Do they finally succeed?\nThe story is a cocktail of many interesting turns of events which every child is bound to devour. It exemplifies the win of endeavour and willpower over any odds, be it a fatal decease or physical problem or extreme weather conditions or unfriendly companionship.\nHappy reading.",

However, this knowledge could only be transferred from a Guru to his disciple by word of mouth. In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, one mystic, who calls himself Guruji, still possesses this knowledge and is using it to empower an innocent personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Only, this empowerment could be a deception and the innocent person is a thirteen-year-old boy with a stutter...\nIn this intertwining tale, an ambitious yet unsuccessful Shankar, in search of his identity, is manipulated to embark on a never-told-before fantasy tale; only to rediscover the father he never knew and unmask the mystical Guruji.\nAmidst this confounding concoction of ancient myths, deluding personas and dispersed emotions, will Shankar ever be able to separate fact from fiction and find his true identity?",

The author has merely identified apparently unconnected areas of knowledge and experience, wandered and explored each of them and allowed them to flow into each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s domains to find new creative dialogues weaving patterns within abstractions. It is not a prescription of what it is or should be, but rather a description of a duet between her mind and her heart dancing in awe, unfettered by the conditioned limitations of human constructs. As Gita romances with scientific knowledge and spiritual experiences, the differences seem to disappear; new expression grounds unfoldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦",

One day at the library, he finds some clues and an unfinished work of his Father. As he strives to resolve the unknown about his Father to restore their lost family pride, he wants to complete his unfinished work too, but his dream and destination seem far-off from the reach of a commoner like him.\nFar somewhere, General Henry and Scientist George Watkins of Planet Cursia dream to build an equal society across the Planets of Star Magneta, but that seems impossible without Extra-Terrestrial Clashes. They devoted their lives in research to bring all the Planets under one umbrella and decide to land on Troy.\nHow Amiel would decide what to do first - resolve the mystery about his Father and win back their lost pride, settle his personal conflicts between friendship and love, do justice with Ethel and Arlyn, or save the Planet? Would he find a way or be torn apart and lost in the Terrestrial Chaos? Endora has lost her Husband years back and now seeing her only son Amiel set out for another dangerous Mission. Monk Narad travels from one Universe to the other to seek an answer to his dilemma. Would he be able to find his answer, would Lord Vishnu be able to help him or would his question keep on running in the timeless space and be lost forever?",

                "post_content": "The book Ã¢â‚¬â€ Pearls of wisdom presents a historical and panoramic view of human civilization. It is a compilation of quotes /sayings of prophets, philosophers, thinkers, poets, emperors, politicians and business tycoons; on various aspects of human lives; be it religions, ethics, morals, business, principles of governance, evolution of science and technology, besides quotes on Nature, Earth, Soul, Love, Beauty, Human Minds, Human Hearts, and Eyes. There are quotes about the qualities of animals; like Dog, Horse, Lion and their influence on human lives. There are in all 26 sections chapters as reflected in the Index.\n\nOn perusal of these quotes following facts emerge:\n\n1) The human race loves to live in peace. The religions, though was intended to achieve peace in society, have unfortunately been one of the main reasons for wars, crimes, destruction, and genocides because of the intolerance among the believers since faith is blind. Rationality had been and is the first casualty.\n\n2) All the religions are the gifts of the East. The gifts of the west are communism and Atheism.\n\n3) Things once considered as blasphemies have come to be accepted as truth. The example of Galileo Galilei is remarkable.\n\n5)The governing principles have been evolutionary. There can never be a uniformed pattern of governance as peoples differ in their thinking and beliefs for that reasons there have been clashes of civilization down the ages.\n\n6)The exploration of our solar systems is the result of endless and insatiable urge in man to unravel nature. The achievements of science and technology belong to the whole of humanity.\n\nI have tried to present a snapshot profile of March of human civilization through the voices of the great minds ever walked on mother earth.\n\nThis compilation will serve as ready reckoner\n\nHappy reading!!!\n\nMamutty chola,\nCEO,\nZams HR Consultants,Mumbai\nmamuttychola@gmail.com",

Love is not what can be expressed in words or with surprises &amp; expensive gifts. Love is a special feeling, a blind faith. It should be felt by both sides, individually, for each other. It should not be forced. Love can never happen through the brain, it happens just like that, without a warning. All the greatest love stories are between strangers.\nWhatever happened between them, how and where, explains how today too, humanity and love exist in this beautiful world.",

Tears rolling down your eyes but going unnoticed?\nWe live in our make believe world, where relationships today depend on which way you swipe your finger; where spending on gadgets are more important than investing in a brighter and healthier future. Women, today, work twice as hard as before and men are more than ever the supportive sorts. We are comfortable, happy and full of life. But Nina, Shikha and many others tell us a different story. Inviting you in, into their lives are women who experience the brutality of the world to an extreme you would never want to be sucked into.\nWhen you switch off the night lamp and pull the covers to have a restful sleep, somewhere, someone is crying for help. In both rural and urban areas of our lovely country, resides evil, awake, alive and laughing at the naivety of people.",

Or to live in earthly comforts, pondering over\nwhat flying in the distant sky would have been like?\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the choice Shikha must make!\nOn a trip to Ladakh, she comes across a lifetime opportunity to fulfil a longstanding dream.\nAlong with that comes the prospect of love which was, for so long, a chimera for her. She\ndabbles in both, promising to turn her back on the life led so far and take a headlong plunge\ninto the life that she has aspired for and which is finally beckoning her...\nIt takes immense courage to follow oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream - to let go of the fears, and to relinquish the\nsecurity that one gets used to.\nWill Shikha be able to cross that yawning gap between her aspirations and her reality? Or\nwill a cruel twist of fate force the decision out of her hands?",

The author Prof. Suvasish Mukhopadhyay is a regular rider\nof UBER and in the last two-three years he came in contact with thousands of\nUBER drivers in different cities of India viz: Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi,\nHyderabad and Nashik. The author deeply studied all the drivers who came in\ncontact with him and selected one hundred and twenty two out of them. This\nbook talks of the pleasure and pain, laughter and tears, struggle and pathos of the\nIndian UBER drivers. Most of them are semi literate and many of them are even\nschool dropout, still due to continuous and unceasing struggle all these drivers\nlearnt with time how to manage a critical situation. Qualified man reads more\nbooks, but these poor drivers read so many human beings and out of that reading\nthey have enriched their experience. It is the strong feeling of the author that the\nUBER drivers are the best managers of the world and for leaning the art of\nManagement there is no need to visit a B- School.",

She was known to end up in unexpected situations, sometimes good and sometimes worst. The brim of life broke down when she was put down to face the bitter truth, the rage of money, the thinking of people around, and a realization of past mishaps. Struggling alone in a closed room was tough, but God did some good deeds too. She was blessed with a mentor, a lover, an admirer of her deeds, a publisher of her views, and a pace-maker for her crackling beats. But as said, it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a simple boy; she ends up falling for her own cousin, who had been brought up in a small city like Allahabad. Things were flowery among them under the nose of creepy uncles and aunts until the fatal hour.\nSociety is brutal, not just for girls, even men are a hampered specie, probably society is all about elders and their confined way of thinking, and the sanity demanded to amend their thought process is the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœout-of-stockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ thing in their market. This is a story of, fight for self-establishment, being smashed by the rules and regulations of the society, the struggle to keep a killed love alive, gathering back of torn away pieces, a push to make a new story, the strength injected by friendship, the insanity of departure. In short a story where every turn is unpredictable and every line is truly done with many dried up tears.",

It makes relationships thrive in the nector of belonging and care.\n\nThe poem are decorated with loveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eternal touch and pangs of separation that are an inseparable part of a womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence. They mirror her inner and outer joys and conflicts of life. They find a way for her to be amidst all her dreams, desires and struggles.\n\nARUNIMA, the reddish glow of the sky at sunrise and sunset represents the brilliance of a womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unexplored deep emotions of love and longing, like RadhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devotion to lord Krishna.\n\nWelcome to the beautiful world of ArchnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ARUNIMA...",

But these stories are soon uprooted and tethered to the turbulent politics unfolding in the state.\n\nPeace returns, like always, but not the past. Chogyal loses his power to rule and life easily settles around changed polarities. Uneasily though, people wonder about the consequences of their choice.\n\nThree decades later, the story reopens accidentally and it seems there is a glimmer of a second chance. Long forgotten tracks are retraced, a purpose is rediscovered, an apology may finally find voice. But what about things that once lost can never be found?",

She becomes more adorable for him.\nHe wants to marry her. But his family does not agree.\nHe wants to disassociate himself with his family to make\nAnjali his life partner. But she, sacrificing her own love\nfor Raj, persuades him not to go against the wishes of his\nparents and instead she offers her assistance in selecting a\nsuitable girl for him recommended by his family members.\nRaj unwillingly accepts the choice of his family and finally\nmarries a girl, whom he has never met before and finds\nhimself at crossroads to balance his life between his love and\nresponsibilities. It takes a long time for him to negotiate\nwith life without his dream girl, Anjali. Tragedies in the\nfamily and the increasing pressure at home widen the\nbreach between the two lovebirds. It creates feelings of\nbitterness and betrayal between the two.\nAnjali not only suffers the loss of all her near and\ndear ones, but also feels betrayed by those for whom she\nhas sacrificed her own peace of mind to make their life\ncomfortable and on whom she desires to depend upon\nduring grey years of her life. She finds herself all alone\nand no one to take care of her. As her age is declining, she\nneeds some social security and decides to look for a life\npartner. She seeks the help of Raj and ultimately chooses\na life companion, a widower with grown-up children for\nherself and one fine morning she goes with a stranger to\nspend her life with, leaving behind her past and breaking\nall her promises made to Raj that her love for him would\nnever change. Due to added responsibilities of the new\nfamily, she finds difficult to cope up with the work pressure\nat the office and is forced to give up the job and leave the\ncity as well as her soul mate for good. Luck strikes again.\nRaj and Anjali establish contact after a long interval. But\nit does not last long. She with her spouse returns to start\nbusiness in the city. Their business fails and they leave the\ncity never to return. Raj is clueless about her whereabouts.\nRaj, at the fag years of his life and still madly in love\nwith Anjali cannot tolerate the absence of his loved one\nand finds himself irreconcilable. He loses the desire to live\nand tries to end his life. But life does not oblige him. He\nhopes to meet one day his Anjali in whom he had found a\nsublime love, inspiration and completeness of life. He has\ncome across a number of women in his life, but no one could\nsurpass that ordinary looking and dark-complexioned lady\ncalled Anjali. His love for her just refuses to wither with\nage. Finally, his hopes start fading like his age. But his life\nlingers on without his loveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦",

The scenes may shoot up the anxiety and adrenaline level of the reader so parental guidence is necessary for children below 18 years of age. This book is all about MI6, the British Intelligence which had fought its last battle to defend Ireland. It underwent huge casualty while dealing with the Columbian drug Mafias. The Columbians threatened to go for nuclear war when challenged and cannot be defeated in conventional war.MI6 found them too rigid and ignore American interference as they were their enemy and decided to wipe them alone but was that really possible when Islamic terrors joined Columbian Mafias. It was a war on the planet which had shaken all including Americans and does Britain and Ireland could ever stop enemy's army invading Dublin and Central London.Something that no one has ever sensed and its a war and the crime which will rock the world.",

Expressed or unexpressed, known or unknown, complete or incomplete. But everyone does have a story. Even if those stories never get finishedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ they live onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nIt is crazy that our first love is always alive and lives all time in our heart. DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how much you try to forget, that feeling never goes away. Does it? Also, at some point in life we all realize that not everything is what it seems.\nYou should always be careful whom you make memories withÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Those things last a lifetime.",

The plan ends with him marrying the love of his life. Exactly what granny wants, ever since the astrologer confirmed to her that, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe girl has been foundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Just that, Jay has ridiculously lost the girl he has deeply loved. So, he is at a loss on how to end his grand plan. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the back of Sheffie and Addie. But will Guvie, his most trusted friend and business partner, stand by him too? Amidst all these, murder strikes.\nWill Jay finally conquer his dreams? Could the astrologerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words be false? How can grannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream come true? JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s karma is closely following him, while all of this is being watched by God, as just another act in His spectacular show.",

She seems to navigate seamlessly and naturally between different elements of nature, rendering a voice to the living and non living, sharing with the reader with a fresh delightfulness the beauty she sees in them all. There is a dreamy texture to some of the poems as she slips away into her own little version of fantasy and the many joys simple things bring. As she meanders through hope and dreams, love and friendship, laughter and some deep questions....she quietly strums the reader's feelings ever so gently.</span>",

To be honest, if you ask me, I believe that in the long run, there is only one side Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the funny side.\n\nMy children Lakshmi and Srihari are big believers in the funny side. Every time they come back from a perfectly serious event such as regular school-day or a music-concert, they get into fits of giggling and will regale anybody who is willing to listen with funny stories which everybody else seems to have missed. They taught me a thing or two about looking at the funny side.\n\nA book like The Adventures of Kudmi Thatha and Other Stories is never really done. All characters and situations in this book are fictional, but any fictional writing is influenced by the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences and environment. Numerous have been the occasions when, just as I thought I was finally done writing the book, yet another memory of some long-forgotten hilarious situation would get re-kindled and I would tell myself, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I must add this to the book.Ã¢â‚¬Â I am sure this will continue in future too. So, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if you find more funny stories in the next edition of Kudmi Thatha.\n\nIf you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it, my purpose in having written it will be served.",

There are many aspects of his philosophy which are highlighted in this book, since he is associated with the field of teaching and learning nearly for three decades for that his view about the education system and philosophy about the education system of the world is portrayed in a very nice manner in this book in several places. Mainly it is highlighted that teaching must be a love oriented process, not fear oriented. He has given very high emphasis of the sexual life of people. He believes in open minded culture and supports the live in culture of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world and he talked at length in this book since sex is an integral and inseparable part of life. No one can deny sex, because he or she is born out of it. Most of us are having a wrong idea about sex and we practise it, but refrain ourselves from, it. That is not correct. In these modern eras our old school of thoughts need true amendment and we need to accept the generation gap and unless we accept it, society will reject us. Because change is inevitable and it is only thing which is bound to take place with time. If any reader goes through this book with sincerity the dimension of his or her life is bound to change forever. Prof. Mukhopadhyay is a counsellor in global level and this is the book through which his philosophy will spread across the world and billions of people will be benefited through this book.",

The Prince and heir to the throne of Corave, the most powerful of these three kingdoms, finds himself at the heart of this struggle, but not because he lusts for wealth. The Prince seeks vengeance, and his only goal is to vanquish the Shadowy Shafer, a vicious leader of bandits, whose horde reigns over the woods of the Golden Mountains, preventing any kingdom from access to their wealth. The Prince finds himself growing to become the strongest and most powerful warrior in Pirth and rises to end the reign of the Shafer, who is believed to be invincible and unbeatable.",

Working on multifarious themes ranging from Nature, God, love, separation, the mechanics of existence and time, the poet ponders on the issues that confront mankind daily. Contemplative and yet not sermonizing, these poems try to capture the very essence of existence and being. The poems are fresh, sensitive and it is the reader who is ultimately called upon to judge so. They are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“golden harvestÃ¢â‚¬Â of the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind and soul.",

While they finally decided to stop fighting, they refused to return the many valuable things they had stolen from each other. Among those was the beautiful, seven headed flying horse Uchchaihshravas. Brahma created three children with special powers that would, at the right time, find these prized possessions and return them to their rightful owners.\n\nNow is the time.\n\nWill Arjun, Meera and Nikhil be able to use their superpowers to find the magnificent Uchchaihshravas?",

A passionate promise of a unique experience to feel the pain and pleasures of the past, present as well as the posterity in the leaves of a single book. Welcome to the entropy of literature, the concept of absurdism, the beauty of everything and nothing all at the same time.Welcome to 'Hyphen'.",

It became a birth-right, rather than unconventional. From Indira GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ferocious reign over India, to Queen ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ascetic rule over the throne, to Mother TeresaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gentle ways, we got see the many facets of successful women.\nSo then the eager, unchaste and rebellious women of the millennium, decided to take their career ambitions a step-ahead, but also a step-back and include the joys of motherhood and domestication. When a bird is given the chance to flee the nest, it always flies back because the warmth and protection of a home and family is encouraging. So, as much as we women love to conquer new feats in our careers, we love coming-back home to the familiarity and love of a home and family. We make sure that the dinners on the table are as crisp and well turned-out as the products at work, and this balance makes us feel invincible. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a high like no other.\nHowever, the struggles to create that balance often begins with the change in mindset. So, rather than being all feminist about it, and tipping the scales to a one-sided bias, let us accept and give credit to the those fathers, husbands, partners , uncles and brothers that sowed these seeds of aspirations and acceptance into former-patriarchal societies. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not make it a power-struggle and give importance to each other towards our success.\nThis work-life balance, and all the sha-bang that is attached to it, is an accumulation of hardwork, meticulous planning, open-mindedness towards criticism and accepting eminent changes in life, to become better, more resilient and more fabulous version of ourselves.",

This was a Saint who was never seen by almost anyone for three decades, and who always spoke to a chosen few visitors from behind a curtain.\n\nLeela's obsessive need to understand the Mahakaal mystery leads her to her mentor Bharat, who reasons that regardless of his true identity, Mahakaal is possibly an enigma holding the key to a saner existence. In choosing to follow his guidelines, both Leela and especially Bharat come into conflict with politicians of all hues. When India is subsequently pulled into a two front war, can Leela triumph over her destiny during her suicidal mission in the Himalayas?",

These essays function more like opinion essays dissecting the very nature of being, becoming, withdrawal and the attainment of perfection. The movie and book reviews don't touch upon the technicalities of movie-making, but they deal with an idea, thought, feeling or conflict the book or movie may have evoked in me.\nThe book is divided into 2 parts. In the first part I have compiled my collected blogs, and in the second half, you get to read reviews of books and movies that I have watched and read. This non-fiction book tries to mock at tradition, and is subversive in its attempt to educate. I hope to prod the discreet reader and provoke strong reactions and emotions for all the touchy issues that I have written about.",

In Part 1 the focus is on the Imperial court and the court etiquette, cultivation of Persian and its enrichment with translations from Sanskrit, patronage of Hindu and Jain scholars. Part 2 contains detailed accounts of the Red Fort and the symbolism of its architecture, the philosophy of jharokha darshan, ceremonies, games and pastimes, the material culture of costumes and jewellery, food, drink and perfumery. The remaining two parts deal with the decline and fall of the Mughal rule and the British Colonial Durbars at the Red Fort. The broadly historical narrative is enlivened by various anecdotes.",

This book is going to break all records. Honestly, sir, your writing is something different. Robin Sharma, Steve Paulina, Gary Vaynerchuk, so manyÃ‚Â booksÃ‚Â I have read. Your book is above them. Your writing has a distinct style and class. Seriously it is such a treat. A classic.\n\nNaveen Kulkarni, Blogger, Director N vision\n\nI have just readÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â first chapter again - Just love it. love it love it. Great read. As always you never disappoint. It is exciting, informative, and very insightful. You are an amazing writer. You have worked so hard on this project. So meticulous and putting each chapter and topic across. I can actually hear you in those writings. You have a super style. You are an amazing writer. Your writing is intoxicating, it's mind-blowing. This book is beautifully written. I never knew so many things about aÃ‚Â personality. This book is so much education onÃ‚Â personalityÃ‚Â transformation. I love all your chapters. You are so talented and wise.\n\nPamela Peters, Fashion Designer.\n\nI am sure you can write down a thesaurus on any subject and take your readers to their atomic level. I think you should be given a P.H.D on this subject and an in-depth analysis ofÃ‚Â personality.Ã‚Â TheÃ‚Â chapter on humor was too good. You are a prolific writer, a wordsmith with a fertile imagination.Ã‚Â TheÃ‚Â world needs to capitalize for a long time to understand in a better way your take on various aspects of life. I am thanking my God for making me your friend. You are a hidden gem, a superstar. Too good man.\n\nHiren Shah, Leading Gynecologist\n\nI have read through all you sent me and simply put is so brilliant. There is a depth and insight intoÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â human mind. is all this going to be inÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â same book?Ã‚Â TheÃ‚Â references from classics like Tom sawyer to contemporary Celine Dion is refreshing and shows you have put a lot of thought into your writings.Ã‚Â TheÃ‚Â 12 versions ofÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â hare and tortoise race, is out ofÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â world. I never saw a doctor so well-read with such immense and diverse talent. This book packs overÃ‚Â 25Ã‚Â years of his distilled, crystallized wisdom. A must-read.",

These might come through as basic things that we all are aware of but we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really put in efforts to include them and carry them out in the best possible manner. Just as every blob (droplet) is equally important in creating an ocean, similarly these small but important techniques included in the right manner will yield the best possible results.",

She seems to navigate seamlessly and naturally between different elements of nature, rendering a voice to the living and non living, sharing with the reader with a fresh delightfulness the beauty she sees in them all.\nThere is a dreamy texture to some of the poems as she slips away into her own little version of fantasy and the many joys simple things bring. As she meanders through hope and dreams, love and friendship, laughter and some deep questions....she quietly strums the reader's feelings ever so gently.",

However, following a dream isn't a mistake. His purported perfect life turns upside down in no time, shattering his only dream.\nAnd then begins the series of Nightmares, which haunts him. They give him sleepless nights. However, there is a nightmare, which occurs a couple of times. And, even though dreams are forgotten when awaked, this particular nightmare is remembered perfectly clear by him.\nWhile leaving with a broken dream and nightmares, Vivan gets attracted to Poonam. He finds that it isn't just love, which draws him towards her. Whereas it is a connection, a deep long-forgotten connection, which ties them together.\nBorn Under A Lucky Star is a story about love, friendship, dream, and parent-children relationship.\nThis is a journey of Vivan Kashyap. A journey where he finds that he isn't the only star-crossed. A journey to find what is lost. A journey to walk blindly on God's path. And, a journey towards Hope.",

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just their authorities and responsibilities that make a God revered, it is their actions and deeds. Your actions made you the closest to Him.Ã¢â‚¬Â\n\nYear 2020, The Republic of Jannah emerged in the midst of a cold war among the five great nations. The same year I, Clarion Ã¢â‚¬Å“LarryÃ¢â‚¬Â Sharma was born.\n\nAt age 12, I lost two of my most important things - My mother and my memories. At age 17, I left home in search for clues.\n\nDuring my quest, my motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death became my sole motivation. I even died chasing every version of truth. In the Afterlife, I was furious at the Supreme God who I felt was manipulating me. He offered me three wishes in order to compensate.\n\nThese three wishes solved the mystery of her death but changed how I looked at life. It changed me.\n\nMy actions indeed made me the closest to Him.\n\nWhat you would have done in my place?\n\nHow did my choices affect my life? Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you find it yourself?\n\nThis is not just another cliche. It is my tale how I emerged as the youngest demigod, how I ended up being 'The Living Paradox'.",

However, following a dream isn't a mistake. His purported perfect life turns upside down in no time, shattering his only dream.\nAnd then begins the series of Nightmares, which haunts him. They give him sleepless nights. However, there is a nightmare, which occurs a couple of times. And, even though dreams are forgotten when awaked, this particular nightmare is remembered perfectly clear by him.\n\nWhile leaving with a broken dream and nightmares, Vivan gets attracted to Poonam. He finds that it isn't just love, which draws him towards her. Whereas it is a connection, a deep long-forgotten connection, which ties them together.\n\nBorn Under A Lucky Star is a story about love, friendship, dream, and parent-children relationship.\n\nThis is a journey of Vivan Kashyap. A journey where he finds that he isn't the only star-crossed. A journey to find what is lost. A journey to walk blindly on God's path. And, a journey towards Hope.\n",

This story justifies the same concept. If a human is to err then he is also meant to correct.\n\nYes, it takes time to realize oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mistakes but once the realization process is over, one must be gutsy enough to accept it and correct it. At times, just a sorry is not enough in friendship and a sorry is nothing without efforts to mend the harm. So from strangers you become best friends, from best friends you become strangers\nagain; the cycle completes itself in a way. But then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conscience as to how one considers the cycle in his mind and how much he values his relationships.\n\nKabeer, Radhika, and VisheshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship, unfortunately, ended in the same college where it took off from. Some intentional mistakes and some situational conspiracies have shaped up the whole story with a question mark in the end. Someone needed to acknowledge and give a befitting reply to the almighty questioner, TIME. They say Ã¢â‚¬Ëœactions speak louder than wordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwords in the form of action speak loudestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ I guess. At least Vishesh proved it so. And finally,in this story, friendship wins against all the odds.\"\"\n",

For every Jasmeet who loves to love there is a Baskar who tells her what love is not. For every Shalaka who wanders around for unwanted, there is an Anila to give her the lap of compassion. Ã¢â‚¬ËœTales That EntailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the relationships based short stories collection delivers spontaneously along the twists and turns of the winding roads of life making it entirely worth the time of the readers.",

But that was simply a convenient argument based on their immediate environs and to feed their insatiable greed. The East was always much more harmonious, just like human societies that survived 50,000 years. But look where it got them? Who were the Ã¢â‚¬ËœsavagesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by the way? We lost morality and succumbed to an individualistic life of comfort, which has resulted in gross inequalities (to their benefit) and unprecedented environmental destruction. Is this Ã¢â‚¬Ëœprogress?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This decision will fundamentally determine our choices for the future. Do we continue up the path of restlessness (or recklessness) or go back down the road of peacefulness (within ourselves) and harmony (with our environment)? The latter will not be easy, though, and the cynic in me says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why bother?Ã¢â‚¬Â The hopeful in me, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why not?Ã¢â‚¬Â But the latter continues to prevail, and that is my single most important reason for writing this book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to leave a legacy for my children. I continue to hope that they may find a life of meaning rather than be swept away in one of indulgence.",

In this avatar he meets Raima Sengupta in a Facebook chat. When they meet, he discovers that she is much younger, but like him, craving intellectual stimulation and freedom from restrictive social norms.\n\nRaima is a victim of a difficult childhood. After losing her father at the age of three, she assumes charge of her ailing mother. Brought up by her maternal aunt, as a teenager she fends off a sexual assault from her lecherous uncle. Now in her 20s, she withstands family pressure to marry since she feels committed to Shom, a married man himself.\n\nBoth agree that despite the compatibility between them, they must remain faceless to\nbalance their relationship with social and professional responsibilities. This seems to be the only way out.\"\n\n",

Authored by a committed and inquiring researcher, it analyses the factors responsible for the ramshackled state of affairs in the country today as a result of many a malaise- mis-governance, dwindling economy, corruption, industrial failure, to name a few Taking up various areas for focused study, like India's resources, political administration, economic growth, development programmes at various levels and impact of globalisation, it examines the mistakes made in the past partly because of Ignorance and partly because of selfish motives in approach, strategies adopted, execution of plans and programmes and evaluation.\n\nGiving vital facts and figures garnered through intense research, the work points out how and why India lags behind in rural development, population control, reform of education, water management, disaster management, power generation, tourism, environmental issues and reform of police, judiciary and defence services and presents insightful and thought-provoking suggestions on how the situation can be remedied. It has also attempted to provide solutions to addressing problems in the NE states and the Kashmir issue.\n\nOwing to the nature of the subject here discussed and the author's unique holistic approach and original perspectives in addressing issues, the book will interest a large range of readers keen to watch India progress. They will feel as if the author is talking about them and is concerned for their well-being. Its fluent style of writing makes it all the more appealing.",

Taking up various areas for focused study, like India's resources, political administration, economic growth, development programmes at various levels and impact of globalisation, it examines the mistakes made in the past partly because of Ignorance and partly because of selfish motives in approach, strategies adopted, execution of plans and programmes and evaluation.\n\nGiving vital facts and figures garnered through intense research, the work points out how and why India lags behind in rural development, population control, reform of education, water management, disaster management, power generation, tourism, environmental issues, reform of police and judiciary and of defence services, and presents insightful and thought-provoking suggestions on how the situation can be remedied. It has also attempted to provide solutions to addressing problems in the NE states and the Kashmir issue.\n\nOwing to the nature of the subject here discussed and the authors unique holistic approach and original perspectives in addressing Issues, the book will interest a largo range of readers keen to watch India progress. They will feel as if the author is talking about them and is concerned for their well-being. Its fluent style of writing makes the approach all the more realistic and interesting.",

Pyar, Dosti aur Zindagi is something that cherishes your love and will also connect you with your loved one in a sublime manner.\n\nPoetry has no bounds, no particular language that is why this book comprises of poems that are written in three different languages (Hindi, English, &amp; Hinglish). This work took nearly 10 years to reach form the writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pen and notebook to a systematically organized book in your hands. Every single line of each poem is filled with emotions, love, and the idea that Pyar (Love), Dosti (Friendship) aur Zindagi (Life) are not three different things, but one.\nFrom the very first poem, you will find yourself in the memories of your loved one and by the last poem you will be a person who is recapitulating the beautiful moments with their loved ones.",

Known for his hard work and mechanical execution of plans, he is the envy of the Cricket world. All is going well with him, and his visibly invincible Indian team, until he meets a suave business tycoon who is set to change the face of sports forever. He throws a challenge at the Indian captain, who finds it hard to refuse. The challenge involves his Indian Team defeating an immaculate team designed and brought into this world, exclusively, to play the sport. This unique challenge, however, is only the beginning. Cricketers from all around the world soon follow the Indian captain in the world of agony and humiliation. The Indian captainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world begins to fall further apart, as the game of Cricket is snatched away from him and every known human cricketer. With any possible attempt at resurrection neutralized pre-emptively, the Indian captain falls into the darkness of despair.\n\nWhen all seems to be lost, his close friends set up a meeting between him and a monk, who loves the game of Cricket. With visionary inputs from the monk, the Indian captain develops a fresh perspective of the game and sees hope and purpose in his existence again. Additionally, an intelligent female acquaintance from the past joins hands to provide her expertise and strategy to plot an elegant plan of attack. Armed with the inspiration from the monk, newly instilled self-confidence from his friends, extraordinary vision from the intelligent womanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and a bizarre team of extraordinary individuals, the captain considers himself well and truly on his way to achieve the impossible. But the road to redemption is never a straight path. He will have to battle his own betrayal and face a brutal past before he could again become the leader of the pack. Will he be able to bring the game of Cricket back into human lives? Will he be able to conquer what should be conquered? Or will he fail again in the monumental task that no human being has ever succeeded at? Will he become a winner? Or will he go beyond winning?\n\nWritten in a crisp, quirky language and celebrating the indomitable human spirit, the book is a science-fiction thriller with the game of Cricket as the backdrop. Narrated in a non-linear fashion, the story has all the elements that go into making a potboiler story like humor, sarcasm, romance, science, data science, robotics, crazy characters, sane characters, self-discovery, self-actualizationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and of course, Cricket! The book outlines a roller-coaster journey of human beings in the future learning to rediscover what it entails to be a human being in a technologically advanced world.",

Trusty, warm, comforting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSometimes, love may fail the moment, as with Babu or falter, as with Neha and Raju.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFamily demand may clash with the emotional world of the child, their laughter tripped up by rules, shadowed by opinions, marred by rage or blocked by apathy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrust vanishes. Family loses promise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSlow realisation dawns.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLove is nowhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYet, love may take charge, as with Rajan and Sona.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFamily moulds itself to hear the unspoken, to clarify the unclear. Honest conversation and laughter rule. Family holds promise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLove is in process, in outcome.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLove is everywhere.",

It is all encompassing and all pervading, though a rare few realize itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence. It has no beginning and has no end Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it was, is and will always exist. It can neither be created nor destroyed. It is Infinite Intelligence that creates everything in existence.\n\nIt is our responsibility to understand it, experience itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence and then learn to cocreate with Infinite Intelligence to identify our inner strengths and make the most of them for our development, growth and evolution. By accessing it, we can change our lives.",

This book, which has a series of illustrated quotes paired with real life cases based on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences, highlights that recovery can be simple and facilitated by the self.\n\nThere is deep stigma associated with OCD, not only in society but also in the minds of those affected by the disorder about themselves. The author unravels seemingly complicated situations and presents easy to comprehend solutions, which are visualised via the illustratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creations that speak as aloud as the words around them. This book in no way attempts to replace medical treatment. It is only\na tool which can enhance the process of recovery.",

Most of us sleepwalk through our youth in trying to win some kind of an identity . Then we stumble upon middle age &amp; scramble to preserve that identity . And suddenly, standing at mid-point , we realize that somewhere in this medley of all the artificial races we were enlisting in, we have quietly let go of our greatness. Partly by default , partly by design. The first pangs of urgency hit us. We know this is no dress rehearsal. It is our own life that is gliding past. We straighten up and reach for it. And try to snare it on print. This book is AyonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt to capture his journey at intermission, narrated through a heterogeneous ensemble of his articles that take you through events, relationships, successes and failures which add up into the randomness of his life that he joins backwards into coherent stories.",

                "post_content": "The book was written in Persian by Hazrat Shah Nematullah Wali (1331-1431 AD) born in Syria. He was a great Sufi Saint who authored over a hundred books in Arabic and Persian languages. Most of the predictions made in this book about six centuries back have come true. He predicted the establishment of Mughal rule in Hindustan with names of kings and the battles that they would fight. He predicted about the British rule in Hindustan, the freedom struggle and the division of the country into two. His predictions about future make the readers curious and compell them to pay attention to the book. Shah Nematullah Wali was born in 734 AH/1331AD and passed away around 834 AH/1431 AD. He was born in Syria but spent most of his life at Samatqand, Herat, Yezd and Kirman. His order of Sufism Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nemat-i-IlahiÃ¢â‚¬Â is still exists in Iran and Faras. The predictions made by Hazrat Shah Nematullah Wali in Persian poetry are of vital importance. Having turned out to be mostly true , his work has achieved heights of fame. He must have been divinely inspired to have been able to describe future events with such clarity, without resorting to metaphorical laguage, leaving no doubt in the reader's mind about the obviousness of the events he was foretelling. Even the names and titles of the historical figures and events he speaks about in his predictions have proven to be correct.",

Or Kala would have started his mission to change the world, Maan was wondering!\n\nThird world war indeed had been fought and won by Kina, a Kamnist rogue state. But Maan did not know then. He could see the collaterals of war there and everywhere! Locked humans in the confine of homes, terror struck. Everything would appear to have been destroyed. The world had been surreptitiously and smartly attacked by bio-weapon of deadly virus, stored in its lab.\n\nOne night Kina army had overtaken the lab silently. They would let loose the bio-weapon on world. All worlds appeared to have been defeated. But this defeat would be termed by the defeated powers of the world as pandemic. Just to fool people and hide their defeat and cowardice, world leaders and powers appeared to have termed it as a natural calamity and pandemic. Or Kina was able to manage them to see it as such, it depends which way and on whose side it is seen!",

Difficult to stop readingÃ¢â‚¬Â - Ujjal Chakraborty, Eminent novelist, and National Awardee film scholar. \"Captures an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deepest longings, restlessness, loss, void and confusion. The surreal and the real merge to create a certain delicious madness. The narrative is gorgeous, deeply moving, lyrical and hilariousÃ¢â‚¬Â - Brahmanand Singh, National awardee and a leading writer. Conventionally, a first novel often suffers the contradictions inherent in sentimentality and piety. It is also branded with the blemish of autobiography. A first-time novelist is eager to pour out his heart and hence his work becomes baroque in its excesses. The author of A Nowhere Man realizes and relishes all that. He is, by your leave, the quintessential zealot, exploring a narrative and expounding a thesis at the same time. What emerges is a work that is comic, sentimental, and macabre. The novel is an irreverent exercise at madness and mindless mayhem within the confines of a racy narrative exterior. There is both conceit and humility, garbed in the guise of Avant-Garde adventure. On the one hand, it tells the simple story of those who loved, made love, lost or won, on the other, it aspires to be a pious elegy of suffering in transit.",

Every rhyme doesn't focus on reasons alone; love has the power to give it wings of imagination and open uncountable realms for experiences to introspect on life on a broader spectrum.\n\nThe author here tries to make a collage of various emotions by dividing the poems in three parts Dreams - Desire - Destiny. She believes life is all about these three psyche of every human being.",

This book encompasses the journey of life and is an amalgamation of different phases of life, un-caging the feelings and words that we had within ourselves. Ã¢â‚¬ËœEscape and FlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a collection of poetry with a different outlook on life and its course. What is your escape? What are the things for which you want to detach yourself?

In most countries and ages, the visually disabled have been considered with few outstanding exceptions, as objects of charity, of pity, of contempt, even of cruelty. They are subjected to this unequal treatment forgetting that they are also entitled to all rights and safeguards bestowed in the Constitution of India.\n\nA comprehensive coverage of legislative and administrative measures for persons with disabilities emphasising need for inclusive education as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is also covered in the light of visually disabled in Hubballi-Dharwad in the State of Karnataka.\nThe book will be helpful for academic community at large and for all those having a humanitarian approach in upholding the rights of persons with disability.",

Author is a graduate in Science stream with Biology / life sciences as his subjects in the graduate course curriculum. The Author's personal relationship with his elder brother, Dr N. Ashok Kumar Patnaik, as on today is a practicing cardiologist at USA, having his very thicker blood relationship and he is much indebted to the support his brother provided for in his personal life and professional legal practice. The Author right from his childhood days was well attached to the studies of his brother, and till date remembers what are the subjects his brother studied in the course of M.B.B.S.\n\nThe Author has encountered of agony with the death of the sister of his wife, 'Rajani Patnaik' was victimized and lost her life for the reasons of callous medical misadventures in the hands of half knowing nascent doctor who was engaged in a private hospital did administered a wrong fatal injection. Then the Author felt the agony of the parents of the victim and to teach lessons to the hospital and the half knowledge treating doctor through the legal approach, was questioned for her misconduct in the consumer forum and ultimately the truth of Medical negligence was established, though the same was dragged up to Supreme Court of India.\n\nIn this background the Author was much exposed to the Medical Science and the Law pertinent to Medical Negligence and his personal feelings were involved for getting the justice of the similarly situated victims of India. The doctor's do commit the crime which is unabated and therefore victims have no know-how to deal with such misconducts of treating doctors who are made scot-free for reasons of want of checks and balances in the legal mechanism for bringing them to Book of Law. So, with all these perceptions and knowledge the Author gained through the practice, and make them know the know-how of the Mechanism of the Medical Negligence which will be helpful not only to the victims, but also to educate the treating doctors to make them aware of the practice of medicine along with the ethical approach and on failure the provisions of book of law which will make them to face the consequences of their wrong doings.",

Their emotions for each other take shape in the eerie backdrop of pouring rains in Mumbai.\n\nBoth of them however encounter knotty issues in their respective homes as their parents oppose their decision to tie the knot with a person from another\ncommunity. Amidst the pain and eventual ecstasy that unfolds in the couple's lives, More Than Just Papad brings alive the fascinating cultural attributes of the two communities. Papad as a cultural stereotype acts as a metaphor for the various stages of Mona's and Sri's journey from love birds to becoming man and wife.\n\nThe book not only constructs an intriguing plot, but also celebrates, in its own unique way, the contribution of Sindhis and TamBrahm Iyers to the daily life of India.",

Underpinning all of JamshedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s triumphs and failures is the steely resolve and grit of his mother, Jeroo Mai.\n\nYoung Jamshed gets bowled over by the lovely Zenobia and they get married. Love and joy is in the air. But is there any such thing as Everlasting Love ?\n\nJamshed falls prey to his biggest weakness and Zenobia is left to bear the brunt of his insensitivity. She finally succumbs to her fate and Jamshed is left to fend for himself along with their two children.\n\nMany years pass and the Captain is now a lonely and depressed man Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ until Life again throws him a challenge. Will he be able to overcome the hurdle at this point in his life?\n\nIndomitable is a moving story of dreams &amp; love interspersed with despair and death. It brings home the inescapable fact that the transience of Happiness &amp; Life and the inevitable spectre of old age and death are interwoven and inseparable.\n\nTogether they form the warp and weft of this joyous and magnificent fabric called LIFE.",

They are universal in nature and represent an outpouring of emotions, thoughts, facts and sensitivities at different levels. The author talks about simplicity of children and education in contrast to the present complex system that complicates a child's mind. She also reflects the practical importance of English as a global language. The idea is to empower teachers frequently with introduction of skills through workshops as reinforcement as well as strengthen and refine the skills of the teacher community.",

It contains snippets of my interactions with various people who have entered my life at different points of time and what lessons I have learned during my interactions with them and how they have shaped my personality and my belief system. Life for me is all about the experiences I have had and I have tried to put forth through this book the way I used the lessons learned in my personal and professional life in situations that I have encountered. The situations which I faced and the manner in which I handled them gave rise to some simple formulas which I have tried to put forth through this book to people who are interested in looking at life from a very simplistic nature. The book is a small effort from my side to put myself in front of the world and hopefully is a start in my literary life.",

Nowhere in the writing is there any trace of pride of accomplishment; there is only a continual learning, loving, surrendering and revelling in the delight of divine grace.\n(From the Forward by Dr Devdas Menon, IIT Madras)",

These\npoems are an eclectic mix, echoing everything from Mumbai to the\nmonsoons to the mundane. They are also about you and me and the\nordinary. If you like observing and absorbing the nuances of life, you\nwill find these words speaking to you.",

To enable students to correlate theoretical topics with the techniques used in\nanalysing complex issues in business situations\n3. To develop skills using which students can develop application matrix for the\ntheoretical topics for real-life problem analysis and resolution techniques\nThe present environment The academic environment across the world to is facing a major disruption on account\nthe global pandemic COVID 19 compelling switching over to online/blended versions of\nteaching and learning process. The main drivers will be use of tools such as case\nmethodology and simulation exercises for ensuring experiential learning\nASMs Initiative\nRealizing this requirement ASM Group with nearly 250 business Case Studies\ndeveloped by its faculty takes pleasure in offering these cases by publishing in case\nvolumes The case studies in this book are appropriate for the courses in management\nstudies\nASM group of Institutes is certain that this book Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Bouquet of Business Case StudiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\npublished by Become Shakespeare.com will receive excellent response from the faculty\n, students and industry executives in India and abroad.",

She is hence, devastated by the short affair with Harry. Who has made her feel so special. Susan runs away to a far-off destination under the pretence of her work, with an NGO. The alien land India allows her to be surrounded by loving people. Her colleague and newfound friend Jia.SusanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspectives on life see a sea change through her routine interactions and chats with Jia. Her life is again shaken up by Danny Brown the CEO of Sportz INC, their projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prime sponsor. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is he just being a good friend or trying to be more? Why?Ã¢â‚¬Â these questions haunt Susan. With coincidences that seem unreal. Susan believes in the sanctity of marriage and does not want anything to do with flings. Susan and Jia travel across rural western India for the implementation of the project. Danny follows them on a weekend to spend more time with Susan. Their jobs keep them separated for weeks together giving her the time she needs to think. He saves Susan and Jia from an attack and nurtures Susan back to health. Just when Susan makes up her mind, her dreams are shattered, by the outburst of DannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-girlfriend Savitri. Heartbroken once again as she finds herself in a similar situation. SusanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural response of flight takes her back to her country. But will Danny give up so easily? How will he get her back? Will the year end, mark a new beginning ?",

                "post_content": "All over the world, a spiritual awakening is taking place, and those who are growing in awareness realise how connected we are to each other, Mother Nature and the Universe. Too long has humankind looked up to orthodox religions for happiness, guidance and support. However, religions have failed miserably in creating a harmonious world. They have hidden crucial knowledge that could hasten humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution and create a much more beautiful world. Although organised religions have effectively given individuals a cultural and political identity, they have prevented humankind from understanding consciousness. This is the reason most people do not understand the difference between religion and spirituality. They think that by performing outer rituals, they will enter heaven or attain salvation. Well, nothing could be further from the truth!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are forces on Earth that want to control humanity by keeping it in spiritual darkness; orthodox religions are a powerful tool in the hands of these dark forces. The average person is like a frog that lives inside a well and knows nothing of the world outside it. This book will introduce you to some unknown facets of your being. It explains how your non-physical bodies steer your life; how a critical mass of people can bring many positive changes on our planet; how anger and violence bring only temporary solutions to conflicts, and evil continues to manifest in different forms; and more. You will learn about the high-frequency light above your physical body. Your human eyes cannot detect this electronic radiation. This light is awaiting your call, and only by invoking it will you know your true identity as a son or daughter of God. By summoning this light, you can bring beneficial changes in your life and contribute to speeding up humankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis book seeks to inspire those people who live the everyday mundane life and are oblivious to the higher realities, universal truths and benevolent forces all around us. If our planet is to make a significant shift to higher consciousness, more and more people need to awaken spiritually. For this, they must free themselves from the indoctrination and programming by religions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIrrespective of whether you have the urge to grow spiritually, this book will give you much food for thought.",

These forms of poetry are combined with the usual subjects of poems - these being a romance, society, wildlife, nature, history, and life in general. As the title suggests, this collection is an ode to the work of poets who have enriched literature - predominantly English literature - with their effervescent and enthralling writing. Therefore, the likes of William Shakespeare, John Keats, William Wordsworth, T.S. Eliot, Wilfred Owen, and the peerless Gulzar are the inspirations behind this work. The fifteen poems herein are written expressly for the lovers of poetry to sink their teeth into. This book, therefore, offers a lot to literary purists while also being engaging and interesting for casual readers with different, varied tastes; in essence, a happy introduction for beginners, and a form of reverence for those initiated into the canon.Ã¢â‚¬â€¹",

We should learn from Nature which never stops in spite of disasters, calamities, pandemics etc. Whether you live or not makes no difference, the Universe will remain Ã¢â‚¬Ëœas it isÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ so your absence from the earth cannot affect the Universe or Nature. Even world activities will not stop without you. Therefore, it will be better if you live the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlife as it comesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nMean to say, accept whatever has been happened. In fact, we cannot halt any happening because happenings are beyond our control. Only one thing is in our power and that is our attitude towards it, we can either accept it or resent it. Thus accepting the event with tranquillity is to rise above it while resenting on it is to be overpowered by it.\n\nTherefore, accept the present moment Ã¢â‚¬Ëœas it is. To obtain happiness and bliss, stop chasing materialistic things such as power, fame, wealth etc. and dive within yourself because\n\neverything is within you. Thus Absolute Peace or Eternal Bliss is exists within you just like musk exists within the naval of musk deer.",

The crystal structure of these materials controls their physical properties. Ferrites have a very low conductivity, which is one of the considerations for microwave applications. The basic electrical and magnetic properties of the ferrites depend upon method of preparation site and valence distribution etc.\nAmong all the ferrites, copper ferrite is interesting and have many technological applications because copper ferrite shows tetragonal structure , changing semi conductive properties and electrical switching when heat-treated under different conditions. Therefore, the electrical and magnetic properties of copper ferrite can be changed with its structure. Further, the presence of Jahn-Teller ion Cu2+ in copper ferrite can lead to a change in electrical and magnetic properties. The influence of Jahn-Teller ion Cu2+ at the octahedral [B] sites can be modified by trivalent and tetravalent ions. Magnetic dilution due to substitution of non-magnetic atoms gives rise to interesting magnetic structures in compounds with spinel structure.",

Spiritualism has lost its role in contemporary life. No doubt, everybody wants peace in their life and no one knows how. A million ways to get peace are being suggested and sold while the true cure is being overlooked.\n\nOnly knowledge can provide true peace to us. This rational and concise approach is unique and the knowledge in this format is not available anywhere in the world i.e. scientific knowledge on how to live happily, peacefully and stress-free in whatever profession and in whatever social strata one is.\n\nThe knowledge covers all 5 aspects of life:\n\n(i) Body (ii) Mind (iii) Relations (friends &amp; family) (iv) Money (V) God\n\nThis knowledge eradicates sorrow and bestows a peaceful &amp; happy life on you. This authentic solution is scientific, logical and easy to apply to create a sorrow-free life.",

They are resilient in the face of obstacles and to overcome it they seek directions from their heroes, both cricketers, and corporate leaders. This exciting journey gives us remarkable tips to refine our mindset and skillset to become an exceptional leader, to build a high-performance team, and to weave a winning work culture.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt does so by taking learnings from something we worship in India - CRICKET. The author is passionate about cricket and so is almost every Indian. Cricket is the most loved and celebrated sport in India. It is a religion, we breathe, pray, and live cricket.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be more helpful if cricket could also help inspire us to reach our goal of becoming a successful leader?\nRead the book to find out.",

Young people are misunderstanding this beautiful feeling as something that is not to be taken seriously. Consequently, people end up being heartbroken and give up on love, relationships, and life. Most young people are heartbroken. The main aim of this book is to help readers understand that it is not love that needs to be avoided but the person who has no understanding of love.\n\nThe focus of this book is the audience who are looking for love and are rebuilding their faith in relationships after a heartbreak. It is especially those people who need to realize it is necessary to move on from the wrong people to move forward in life. I am pretty sure this book is going to help because it shares something that most readers can relate to.",

Author is a graduate in Science stream with Biology / life sciences as his subjects in the graduate course curriculum. The Author's personal relationship with his elder brother, Dr N. Ashok Kumar Patnaik, as on today is a practicing cardiologist at USA, having his very thicker blood relationship and he is much indebted to the support his brother provided for in his personal life and professional legal practice. The Author right from his childhood days was well attached to the studies of his brother, and till date remembers what are the subjects his brother studied in the course of M.B.B.S.\n\nThe Author has encountered of agony with the death of the sister of his wife, 'Rajani Patnaik' was victimized and lost her life for the reasons of callous medical misadventures in the hands of half knowing nascent doctor who was engaged in a private hospital did administered a wrong fatal injection. Then the Author felt the agony of the parents of the victim and to teach lessons to the hospital and the half knowledge treating doctor through the legal approach, was questioned for her misconduct in the consumer forum and ultimately the truth of Medical negligence was established, though the same was dragged up to Supreme Court of India.\n\nIn this background the Author was much exposed to the Medical Science and the Law pertinent to Medical Negligence and his personal feelings were involved for getting the justice of the similarly situated victims of India. The doctor's do commit the crime which is unabated and therefore victims have no know-how to deal with such misconducts of treating doctors who are made scot-free for reasons of want of checks and balances in the legal mechanism for bringing them to Book of Law. So, with all these perceptions and knowledge the Author gained through the practice, and make them know the know-how of the Mechanism of the Medical Negligence which will be helpful not only to the victims, but also to educate the treating doctors to make them aware of the practice of medicine along with the ethical approach and on failure the provisions of book of law which will make them to face the consequences of their wrong doings.",

Some energy got converted into elementary particles, the Ã¢â‚¬ËœembryosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of all matters from microscopic objects to gigantic galaxies. Earth was born much later as a barren rocky protoplanet. Afterward evolved gloriously as a blue-green sphere with several layers of rock structures, and water on the surface. Molecules of life got synthesized under the water through an abiogenesis process. Then unicellular organisms evolved and advanced to multicellular organisms. Finally, human beings came. The human body has superb physiology of several organ systems whose functions vis-ÃƒÂ¡-vis dysfunctions and medicinal interference get supervised by the brain. The brain also helps thinking, communicating with the environment through a nonmaterialistic mind that builds our creativity and human relationships using neural signals. Does interaction matter from materials to mind? LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s find the answer.",

Some men go through spirals of Decadence, spending years in the pursuit of the authentic, becoming obscure and absurd, finally losing the difference between real and unreal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nExhausted with reasoning and self-reflection, with a subsequent lack of self-control breeds fear, permeating the surroundings. The road to Freedom, or so the narrator believed in until his own experiences begin to unhinge him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Journal of a man, alienated and occasionally delusional, trying to articulate a method to overcome the ephemeral only to severe ties with the present. Will he understand the deeper meaning of existence after being in limbo, wasting with his degenerating memories and desires?",

                "post_content": "A Beauty By Its Blue Reflection is the 27 years journey of an Indian girl, including different phases of life with different perceptions but a single thought. Neelima grew up in a lower middle-class family, where people didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even want to accept her as their daughter. Her journey has gone through tiny tales of ups and downs in life. Everyone has an influential story. Sometimes, oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learning phase can be a solution to tackle a similar problem in someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. All chapters here can make you flow with emotions like happy, sad, inspired, adorable and independent because NeelimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is little logical &amp; more magical as framed by a Software engineer.\n\nAs a software engineer, I tried to write this book in a pattern as we develop a software which we use to call a waterfall model which goes through several phases like analysis, design, coding testing, &amp; maintenance. So here, I considered life as software and have written the book as making different phases of life one after the other. Last but not the least, why does the index of chapters start with 0 and numbers are written inside the square brackets? because in basic computer programming languages array indexes start with zero. Although Zero is one of the turning points of NeelimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.",

I have come across so many studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ parents and visitors. During my interaction with them I have listened to their stories and came to the conclusion that everyone has some magic in them which they need to know.. some need just a push whereas some need to be guided and motivated. I believe we need to spread out that magic out. Keeping this in mind I have tried to spread some magic in form of my writing. I have worked on all the small aspects and tried to conclude what are the things needed in once life to spread out magic and motivate people.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTips for successful life, preparing yourself for success, positive approach, self-confidence, follow your inner voice, some examples are mentioned in the book for the readers to get upgraded and hope this book of mine will help them to chase their dreams to achieve success in life.\n\n&nbsp;",

Today I dreamt about her, and it was not just a regular kind of dream, it was like an erotic dream. Oh my god, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m feeling really shy,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Siddhant is in his second year of graduation. Though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the most intelligent and popular guy in BHU, he is just okay. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straightforward but confused, he enjoys life but cries sometimes, shy and sort of cool, he hates his okay life. But most importantly, he is waiting for his right time, the right time for career thinking, love, movies, dating, sex and growing up. For now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just about his idiot friends, a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnever foundedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crush, a weird family, some dark secrets, a shrink and of course, HER. But for how long? Standing with the crowd doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make sense, so how do you stand out? How do you cope with the pain? How do you become spectacular from just O-K-A-Y?",

Many times our heartbreaks, we feel betrayed, our parents advocate their beliefs on us and sometimes an angle in the form of humans comes to our rescue and changes our lives completely. Love is blind, Love is sometimes ruthless, but if you believe in love truly, it will never fail you. Unconditional love not necessarily would come from our own biological parents, it may even come from people who you are unknown to you. Most importantly you need to know that You Reap what you sow.\n\nWhile writing these stories, the author tries to bring all Action, Heart Wrenching tales, Romance, Drama, Comedy, Life in a Metropolitan City, Societal Pressures under one roof.",

Friends turn hostile over that one realization and the child Sunil resigns himself to a life as a punching bag. As if this abuse of their only son was not enough, the Acharya familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is shattered one day by a terrible tragedy and they leave their home in Gaibadh overnight for a new life in India. The new life in his adopted motherland takes Sunil on an unheard-of journey, a journey you will identify every step with and pray it has not happened. One day, when he was only 39, doctors tell him that he has just a month to live. His was a life wasted. There is only one hope for him: he had learnt as a priest that every soul is given a chance to redeem itself and earn a place in KrishnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abode. Will it hold true for him? Woven into the life of Sunil and his family are questions critical to the future of Hindus in India. Is the path of non-violence a recent invention or has it been around for ages? What does Krishna tell us about being non-violent or tackling adharmis? Are Hindus facing an existential crisis in their own land?",

They are Kamala Kar Rao, Gautham, Maarthaanda and Singaara Muni. Kamala Kar from a conservative family background was always an academically bright student who would become a Post Graduate. A girl from a resourceful business family, extremely goal-oriented, would finally win over him with her strong conviction of family and societal values. Gautham, having been attracted to spirituality would hop from one place to another seeking Spiritual Gurus while intermittently taking care of his agricultural lands. He would ultimately get attracted to a girl from a humble and pious family, thus marrying her. Maarthaanda would, though well-read, becomes a drug peddler and gets jailed in a foreign country, and ultimately gets killed by gunfire while trying to flee. Singaara Muni would become a psychopath and kills his mother for having ditched himself and his Father. He ultimately becomes mentally deranged, and due to his mindless violent deeds gets killed by the security guards of a mental hospital. Both the ladies in the novel are women of great substance with an emotional and honest feel. In short, this novel takes its readers through the temples of the heart where bells chime, winds blow and lamps die.",

The lockdown that followed as a result of a hitherto unknown virus (Covid-19 of course!) created a fertile ground for more stories to spawn, and before long a collection waiting to fall into the hands of a willing reader was born.\n\nThe stories have a languid pace that allows plenty of room for subtlety, but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fall into a specific genre or theme. Some have an essential thread of humour running through them, while others pack in a pleasant element of surprise. And some may leave a hint of an uneasy aftertaste. These, the writer recommends, are best relished like an exotic aperitif! Bon Appetit!",

Swinging on such diverse portrayals of topics, you may find a glimpse of yourself in her musings, for it is you and the millions of others outside her bedroomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s window who have culminated in the writing of her first book.",

Feminism used to be about equality between the sexes and treating people with dignity. However, now, feminism is full of dangerous, iniquitous, and harmful ideologies which irreparably and seriously harm the people of our society, both men and women.\n\nSome of these ideologies include glorifying promiscuity, wrecking the nuclear family unit, false victimhood narratives, modern gender theory, the steady societal and institutional feminisation of men, and so much more.\n\nIn this book, we are going to debunk these ideologies, and you are going to learn about how evolutionary biology, masculinity, femininity, moral values, and ethics made our civilisation great, and how modern, radical feminism seeks to undermine these values, ethics, traditions, and norms, posing a great detriment to our society and harming everyone in the process.",

The three of them become very good friends and are seen having gala moments in the forests. The scene from Bubaland takes a twist when FeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is in danger, leaving MO &amp; Angka in a fix.\n\nOM, a wise bull comes to their rescue suggesting the Sacred Nectar from the Secret Valley as the only way to rescue Fero. Both OM &amp; MO set on an adventure ride in their two wheeler scooty in the middle of the night to draw the Sacred Nectar. While they encounter a lot of hurdles from the demon Mandeha, OM reveals some secrets that help MO to not just tackle the demon and bring home the Sacred Nectar but also gives a glimpse of her true purpose and identity.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the message of the Upanishads, the most precious wisdom of life has been presented in a story format through interesting sequences and plots with a sole objective of getting the youth to think and introspect about the highest dimension in life!",

More so, if they have been listening to you, is it worth asking for a second chance at love?\n\nVikram was living a reasonably happy life with his wife and two adorable kids and was always thankful to the Gods for whatever they blessed him with. He liked his life, but nevertheless, it was boring and lacked excitement. Vikram then decided to take control of things and of himself; he decided to fall in love. Now, there was a lot of action in life but the price he paid for all the thrills and chills was too heavy. Vikram lost his freedom to another woman. His favourite food, his favourite pastimes, his friends, his outings, and everything else that mattered, ends up being sacrificed at the altar of love.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPurvi was living a dull life until she meets Vikram and decides to spice it up. This was a man she was in love with when in college. She was single after being separated from her husband, and ready to mingle. She had been through a lot of drama in the past and wanted a no-frills relationship. In Vikram she found a man she could dictate terms to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs it worth losing a woman you love for your own peace of mind and then asking the Gods to set you free?\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœGaafilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the story of one such careless man who, for a dash of thrill in his life, ends up throwing all caution to wind; only to go on the brink of disaster himself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDoes he survive?\nOr, does love toss him around like a ragged puppet?\nDo the Gods give him another chance?\nRead Sanjana ChhabraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœGaafilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to know what fate Vikram meets.",

It aims to improve the adolescence phase when kids are yet to gain maturity and at the same time parents get a peek into the teen world. There is fun, joy, action, drama, tears and learning based on what the young mother of teens experiences on a daily basis. Conflicts, disagreements, less warm interactions and negative behaviours have been expressed through real life incidents of teenagers.\nThe book ends on a happy note by showing teenagers to be more efficient and helpful than perceived. Solutions coming from them bring in a twist in the incidents making the book more acceptable. It gives parents a fresh outlook to take the teenagers world in their stride. It fulfils the aim of bridging the communication gap which is common among the parents and teens of today.",

In all the poems, without exception, one can seek sheer aesthetic joy. The effortless use of powerful imagery, symbols, synecdoche, irony, paradox and rhetoric speak volume about this. Young dynamic poet. Above all, the subtle and sublime side of catharsis as a mode of cleaning is commendable. In poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sincere passion bubbles forth in simple yet effective words budding from intense awareness. Each poem. Smacks of fine frenzy with practice freedom. The strong poetic insight is inextricably woven into the text of each poem. Behind each poem one can visualize. Social thinker and a staunch reformist. As a literary Critique and an ardent lover of creative writing, I have intense pleasure in recommending her poems and inviting all the readers to savour the scrumptious treat. Beneath the seeming conflicts and contradictions of the mind, there is an inherent note of positivity in most of the poems. May her endeavour be crowned with success.",

If humans can eat, sleep, talk, and feel pain, so can dogs, cows, and chickens, or for that matter any other living being. What about a world where dogs protest against atrocities on calves or Ã¢â‚¬Å“hoomansÃ¢â‚¬Â fight with other Ã¢â‚¬Å“hoomansÃ¢â‚¬Â so that animals are treated with kindness and compassion? Changing the World: One Bite at a Time is a sparkling and ambitious book which aims to educate the world about veganism, a lifestyle choice and a movement that stems from humane effort to stop cruelty towards animals.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The protagonist is Soldier James, a domesticated dog, who does not understand where Chicababy CoCo, his chicken friend, and Bachua, his calf friend, suddenly disappear. You have to read the story to find out how James deals and fights with so many problems, one bite at a time. From the world of humans, there is Radhika Didi, a young NGO worker who tries to to teach people that it is time to stop treating animals cruelly, considering that they are an important part of our universe. With colorful characters and witty twists, Changing the world is a funny and sensitive story for children, with a message for the young and adults alike.</div>",

Inside himself someplace, man waits for his arrival. 2020 &amp; 2021 were two years in our lifetime that we spent being lonely, together.

There is no underlying theme to the standalone chapters, except for the fact that they all sit on overlapping boundaries of work &amp; life of everymen who were forced to hit pause button in the past twenty months &amp; who, through their own unique orifice of suffering, re-discovered the meaning of work &amp; life in their own ways while being confined inside a forgotten planet called home.",

                "post_content": "The book is basically about my hardships, challenges, and struggles encountered at every stage of my life, right from the Adolescence age till retirement from the Indian Army and thereafter, and how I overcame these with sagacity, resolute will power, determination, wisdom, and by remaining in a state of high life condition. My supersession in the army never dampened my spirits or traumatized me or my family. I continued to give my very best under all circumstances and situations. Like any other person, I too had my infatuations, crushes, and emotional attachment with the opposite sex. But my loyalties with my wife were never compromised. We are leading a very happy and contented married life with total harmony in the family comprising of my two sons and one daughter- in - law and my 3 grandchildren. My eldest son is married to an Irish lady and they are staying in Drogheda county in Ireland. Incidentally, the marriage of my son was solemnized in our presence in Ireland in July 2010.\nTruth has been my fundamental ingredient, which put me in embarrassing situations many times. I firmly believe in the dictum that,\" A bitter Truth is always better than a sweet lie and two wrongs do not make a right.\" Whatever tasks were entrusted to me were undertaken by me meticulously and methodically in an honest and transparent manner without bothering about the negative perception, if any of others.\n\nI and my wife 's induction into Nichiren Daishonin Buddhism was a shot in the arm, which provided us with a golden opportunity to improve ourselves as good human beings and continue to lead a life of \" Absolute Happiness.\" I have always endeavored to live a King-sized life on my own terms and conditions. I have been very candid ( but not a cribber ) in my opinions in calling a spade a spade, leading to my genuine and selfless intentions to be misconstrued at times in the environment. And for which I had to suffer emotionally.\n\nI was a regular nonstop drinker for 43 years, but suddenly I left this addiction including gambling of horse racing and IPL cricket matches a few years ago in February 2017. It was purely due to my determination and will power, especially doing so without any therapy, medical intervention, and rehabilitation. My friends have been my lifeline and I always endeared to love and like their company. Writing my Autobiography was my long-cherished dream, which I ventured to fructify during this sudden lockout enforced upon us due to the corona virus. I always knew my inner strengths and weaknesses. Nothing is impossible in this world and I firmly believe in the dictum that, \" you become whatever you think.",

That's exactly what Lulu delivered every time before flying away. - Kavi Arasu, Facilitator and Talent &amp; Organizational Change specialist\n\n- They are called \"\"nut- crackers\"\", but Lulu himself is a hard nut to crack! All- seeing, omniscient, with a wise and witty opinion on all that he sees, Lulu is tough competition to even the wisest owl. It is pleasure to flit through his world of contemporary happenings. - Ms. Anjali Kanitkar, Founder Trustee Aroehan, Former Director Social Audit, Govt of Maharashtra\n\n- The alter-ego is a fascinating phenomenon. Vivek Patwardhan has a muse in Lulu. To animate the character of a parrot with wit, wisdom and learning makes for a conversationalist. One with the most pertinent curiosity in the moment. The weave of justice, tragedy and paradox of everyday living in India is this collection's high point. Reminds us of George Menezes' 'Your middle is showing' columns from the pre-internet era. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dr Joseph George, Leadership &amp; OD Facilitator\n\n- The art of storytelling, with spice, punch and the persona of Lulu is what hooks all of us to the VivekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blogs. The reader enjoys the dialogues that fly back and forth between AuthorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insights and Lulu's sharp repartee. - Sujata Deshmukh, CEO, Tutul Consulting",

We decided we wanted to express our infuriation with words, without sugar-coating anything and expressing reality as it really is - partly from experience and partly from observation.\n\nThis is a collection of works comprising poetry, essays, short stories, diary entries, epigrams, open letters written by the co-authors.\n\nA shloka in Sanskrit states that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yatra Nariyastu Pujyante, Ramante Tatra DevtaÃ¢â‚¬Â, which means that the Lord resides in the land where women are worshipped. For all our lofty cultural ideals, the reality is pitiful. Gender bias and sexual harassment largely plague the lives of most women, holding them back. In this book, there are various emotional accounts based on some real stories, illustrating the hardships that are the unfortunate reality faced by thousands of women - be it dowry, domestic violence, acid attacks, forced prostitution, or rape. In our book, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t simply find short stories or straightforward open letters; we are here to represent our voice using art &amp; literature in the hope that our country has eyes to gawk the reality.\n\nWe are here to enunciate.\nWe hope to throw light upon these issues, so we can all collectively agitate to change this repulsive culture of wronging women, which has set in like an indelible stain on our social fabric. We deserve better; we can do better; and, we must do better. Our society can only flourish when it is fair to all. This book is a clarion call to voice our concerns, fears, and desires altogether for an India which is free from gender bias, where women do not have to settle for feeling unsafe as a way of life, where women have equal access to opportunities, where women arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t held back by fences, barriers, and ceilings at every stage.",

While our heroes are intelligent and profound in many ways, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the women from both the Hindu and the Muslim community, who join hands to fight the prevailing evil against the patriarchal society and the superstition devised against women. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an ode to women of the era when the idea of feminism didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even exist remotely in India. The story of Antarjwala attempts to define women, not by their social or religious backgrounds, but by the sheer fact that they are women trying to find their place in a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world.\n\n&nbsp;",

The admission that I am not happy when chanting, or even worse, chanting is drudgery I have to do, can be a painfully shocking thing to admit to oneself and others. It takes honesty and courage to acknowledge that you have not yet realized the truth about yourself and continue to feel dissatisfied and unhappy with your life of chanting. If you find yourself described here in these words, then this book is for you.",

He started this research in an early age borrowing books from British and American Libraries in Mumbai. Much of his work is based on divine scriptures. Quoting verses from Old Testament, Bible, Quran and Vedas, with striking resemblance he is revealing the unknown Secrets of God. The resemblance of verses from divine religions has been discussed by many scholars. Here, in this book Sid tries at Ã¢â‚¬ËœreasoningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. And this reasoning develops striking secrets of God.\n\nThere are new subjects related to the Supreme God which are not discussed by scholars so far. AQ Sid is treading on this unknown Terrans. A chapter in this book, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why Messengers were sent to mankind and what were the reasons behind the miracles of MessengersÃ¢â‚¬Â has a very strong reasoning. The facts and reasons behind miracles of Messngers are truly revealing a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsecret of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Another chapter, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAge, Fate and destinyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is also linking these most talked about subjects to a secret of God.\nThere are no exhaustive lecturing or discussions in any chapter. All chapters are concise and well supported by valid reasoning in an interesting narration. The book also justifies why there are different faiths while the Creator is only One. This chapter will give enough food for thought for any inter faith event.",

What will happen at the end? How will they face all the adverse situations? Will they encounter anyone else on the way? Will they use the wand finally? And most importantly, will they survive?\n\nAll these answers and much more are stored in this exciting book where each chapter will project a new aspect of life which will prove once again the power of hope at the end.\nHappy Reading.",

Our curiosity has created a large system of knowledgeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa forest, so to speak. Yet, almost all our knowledge is exhibited to us in a form that is inherently embedded in a particular discipline. But what if we free this knowledge from all subjective biases and absorb what it has to offer?\n\nWhile all of us do look at these metaphorical trees of knowledge individually, sometimes looking beyond teaches us more. But what can we learn when we take a step back and zoom out? What does, say, astrophysics teach us about our own equation of happiness? And the nature of an economy about our daily social interactions?\n\nThese correlations open themselves up to interpretations for the reader, be it the purpose of humanity or the meaning of spirituality. Yet, on our quest for infinitely greater knowledge, will we ever reach the end?",

Green leopards,\nflying whales, marshmallow wars &amp;amp; a quirky origin story of everything from gender equality to global warming.\nA cynical poet &amp;amp; an affluent socialite spend an evening together &amp;amp; empty each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hearts of all the unused\nmelancholy in them. An incoherent girl helps simplify the life of the most sorted boy of her class. A reluctant\npurchase of a jar of peanut butter leads to a serendipitous discovery of a dead author. A fiction writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\ncharacters rise in revolt &amp;amp; refuse to obey his pen. A deserted town that has only unmanned flower stalls left in it.\nTwo men from different generations cling on to each other with their last grip on a vanishing bloodline. Two\nhyper-competitive professionals become friends for life under the unlikeliest of circumstances. A voyeur and an\nexhibitionist discover one another, each unaware of the otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of reality. Two star-crossed lovers whose\norbits keep colliding &amp;amp; drifting away from each other. A man misses his regular commute &amp;amp; walks into an\nalternate existence in a strange land. A queer old man shows up &amp;amp; intrudes young Kafka just as he is about to\npropose to his girlfriend. A man falls back in love with his wife the day after their divorce. An age ends &amp;amp;\nanother begins when three destinies come together during a brief intermission for one violent collision before\ndisintegrating forever, taking all the music with them.\nThese are only a few of the routes by which Ayon Banerjee takes you on a roller-coaster ride of plots that cut\nthrough genres &amp;amp; weaves together an unputdownable collection of stories which seamlessly drift from the\nclassical to modern style of telling short stories that narrate missed journeys &amp;amp; accidental destinations, archived\nconversations &amp;amp; clandestine confessions, love &amp;amp; loss, destiny &amp;amp; time.",

I live life to the fullest, always looking to doing things I have not done before. All my learning comes from doing, not merely reading.\n\nThis philosophy has helped me grow beyond the confines of education, profession and society, and explore my creative side. I seek expression in writing stories and making short films.\n\nFlirt with Life is my third book, after Faceless Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Only Way Out and An Anglo-Indian in Love. As with my previous books, there is a bit of me here too, but in the form of quotes, thoughts, observations and beliefs from a lifetime of flirting with being an engineer, entrepreneur, patent holder, son, husband, father, creator and love guru!",
